To reduce the operating costs, the government of Byteland has decided to optimize the road lighting. Till now every road was illuminated all night long, which costs 1 Bytelandian Dollar per meter and day. To save money, they decided to no longer illuminate every road, but to switch off the road lighting of some streets. To make sure that the inhabitants of Byteland still feel safe, they want to optimize the lighting in such a way, that after darkening some streets at night, there will still be at least one illuminated path from every junction in Byteland to every other junction. <br><br>What is the maximum daily amount of money the government of Byteland can save, without making their inhabitants feel unsafe? <br><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file contains several test cases. Each test case starts with two numbers m and n, the number of junctions in Byteland and the number of roads in Byteland, respectively. Input is terminated by m=n=0.
