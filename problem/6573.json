He finds that there are n cars running in the east-west direction with the i-th car passing the intersection at time ai . There are another m cars running in the north-south direction with the i-th car passing the intersection at time bi . If two cars passing the intersections at the same time, a traffic crash occurs. In order to achieve world peace and harmony, all the cars running in the north-south direction wait the same amount of integral time so that no two cars bump. You are asked the minimum waiting time.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains two integers n and m (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; n, m &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 1, 000).
