Flynn is ready for another tour around. Since the tour would take three or more days, it is important to find a hotel that meets for a reasonable price and gets as near as possible! <br>&#xA0;&#xA0;But there are so many of them! Flynn gets tired to look for any. It&#x2019;s your time now! Given the &lt;p<sub>i</sub>, d<sub>i</sub>&gt; for a hotel h<sub>i</sub>, where p<sub>i</sub> stands for the price and d<sub>i</sub> is the distance from the destination of this tour, you are going to find those hotels, that either with a lower price or lower distance. Consider hotel h<sub>1</sub>, if there is a hotel h<sub>i</sub>, with both lower price and lower distance, we would discard h1. To be more specific, you are going to find those hotels, where no other has both lower price and distance than it. And the comparison is strict.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are some cases.
