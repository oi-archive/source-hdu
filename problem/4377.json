And he is struggling with it!!!=  =<br>For such an ACMer like you, it is commonly believed that you must know the Longest Increasing Subsequence problem. Now Let&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s define some useful functions and symbols:<br>Let U(A) be the length of the longest increasing subsequence of the original sequence A;<br>Let D(A) be the length of the longest decreasing subsequence of the original sequence A;<br>Let H(A) be the maximum value of U(A) and D(A), that is H(A) = max{U(A), D(A)}.<br>H(A)!!! Ah... Zauber anzahl, ist es nicht?<br>Now YCC wants to study the attributes of all the permutations of integer numbers from 1 to N. He wants to get such permutation P having minimum H(P). If more than one permutation satisfies the condition, you should give the lexicographically smallest one.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer T which indicates the number of test cases.<br>The following T lines each contain an integer N (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 100000).","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each case, output N space separated integers in one line, which denote the permutation expected.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n1\n2\n3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n1 2\n1 3 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2012+Multi-University+Training+Contest+8&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2012 Multi-University Training Contest 8 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
