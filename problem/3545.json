You can assume the color of square (X, Y) on the board is A<sub>x,y</sub> which is an integer between 0 and 255. For the beauty of the board, HH decide to paint the board following the rules : <br>1) A<sub>x,y</sub> &gt;= A<sub>x,y-1</sub>.<br>2) For some given pairs of (X1, Y1) (X2, Y2), A<sub>X1,Y1</sub> = A<sub>X2,Y2</sub><br>Your task is to calculate how many ways there are to paint the board.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases, the first line of input contains a single integer denoting the number of test cases.<br>For each test case, the first line contains an integer N and M, denoting the length of the board and the number of additional rules.
