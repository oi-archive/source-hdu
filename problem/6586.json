He wants to choose a subsequence of the string whose length is $k$ and lexicographical order is the smallest. It&apos;s simple and he solved it with ease.<br>But Jerry, who likes to play with Tom, tells him that if he is able to find a lexicographically smallest subsequence satisfying following 26 constraints, he will not cause Tom trouble any more.<br>The constraints are: the number of occurrences of the $i$th letter from a to z (indexed from $1$ to $26$) must in $[L_i, R_i]$.<br>Tom gets dizzy, so he asks you for help.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains multiple test cases.
