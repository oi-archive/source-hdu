Every time, you can select several edges and delete them. The edges selected must meet the following condition: let $G^\\prime$ be graph induced from these edges, then every connected component of $G^\\prime$ has at most one cycle. What is the minimum number of deletion needed in order to delete all the edges.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
