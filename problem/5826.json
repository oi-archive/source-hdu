The track can be considered to be a number line. The balls can be considered to be particles with the same mass.<br><br>At the beginning, ball i is at position Xi. It has an initial velocity of Vi and is moving in direction $Di.(Di \\in {-1, 1})$<br>Given a constant C. At any moment, ball its acceleration Ai and velocity Vi have the same direction, and magically satisfy the equation that Ai * Vi = C.<br>As there are multiple balls, they may collide with each other during the moving. We suppose all collisions are perfectly elastic collisions.<br><br>There are multiple queries. Each query consists of two integers t and k. our task is to find out the k-small velocity of all the balls t seconds after the beginning.<br><br>* Perfectly elastic collision : A perfectly elastic collision is defined as one in which there is no loss of kinetic energy in the collision.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of testcases.<br><br>For each testcase, the first line contains two integers n &lt;= 10^5 and C &lt;= 10^9.<br>n lines follow.
