The ports are numbered $1$ to $N$. Each line is occupied by a Weitian. Each Weitian has an identification number.<br><br>The $i$-th $(1 \\leq i \\le M)$ line connects port $A_i$ and $B_i$ $(A_i  \\ne B_i )$ bidirectionally, and occupied by $C_i$ Weitian (At most one line between two ports).<br><br>When Mr.Quin only uses lines that are occupied by the same Weitian, the cost is $1$ XiangXiangJi. Whenever Mr.Quin changes to a line that is occupied by a different Weitian from the current line, Mr.Quin is charged an additional cost of $1$ XiangXiangJi. In a case where Mr.Quin changed from some Weitian $A$&apos;s line to another Weitian&apos;s line changes to Weitian $A$&apos;s line again, the additional cost is incurred again.<br><br>Mr.Quin is now at port $1$ and wants to travel to port $N$ where live many fishes.
