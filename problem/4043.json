Since Cirno is a ShaBao, she just presses a random key on the keyboard for every 0.5 second, expecting to make a BiShaJi. <br>The battle begins. Having tried exactly 9 times, she finally makes a BiShaJi! She find herself summoned N iceballs!!! Then Sanae&apos;s HP decreases to 0 immediately....It should have been like that. But Cirno is too simple, always navie. She doesn&apos;t know how to handle the iceballs, so she starts to press the keyboard at random, again.<br>Let&apos;s see how the iceball damages. Each iceball has a fixed energy: the first ball&apos;s energy is 2^0, the second ball&apos;s energy is 2^1,..., and the N-th ball&apos;s energy is 2^(N-1). The damage caused by an iceball is equal to its energy. Cirno will shoot N times. Since Cirno is pressing the keyboard at random, each time Cirno will choose exactly one iceball with equal possibility to shoot out. Once shot out, the iceball can&apos;t be chosen again. And even worse, the target may be either her opponent or herself, with equal possibility(50%). What a big ShaBao she is. =_=<br>During shooting, once Cirno&apos;s HP is less than Sanae&apos;s, she will lose the game. Otherwise, she wins. <br>You may assume Sanae did nothing while Cirno&apos;s shooting(all damages are caused by Cirno&apos;s iceball), and their original HP are both 2^N (No one will die in the middle of the battle unless Cirno&apos;s HP is less than Sanae&apos;s).<br>Here comes the question: Can you calculate the possibility of Cirno&apos;s victory?<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line an integer C (C&lt;=30), the number of test cases. <br>For each case, the only line contains one integer N(0&lt;N&lt;=500), indicating the number of iceballs.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each case output a fraction, the possibility of Cirno&apos;s victory.
