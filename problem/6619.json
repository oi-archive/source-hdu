Of course, he jumps over the eaten tree which has no height.<br> *Just after every jump, he can have a break. After each break, he restores energy. It means that his energy becomes the total sum of heights of all eaten trees.<br>But he has limits, he can have at most K breaks and eat at most M trees.<br>You have to find the maximum score that the horse can gets.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer T (1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10) denoting the number of test cases.<br>The first line of each test case contains three integers N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10000), K (0 &lt;= K &lt;= min (50, N - 1)) and M (0 &lt;= M &lt;= min (50, N)).<br>The second line of each test case contains N integers h1, h2 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; hn (1 &lt;= hi &lt;= 10000), where hi denote the height of ith tree.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print the maximum score that the horse can gets.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n4 1 1\n4 2 3 1\n4 2 4\n4 2 3 1\n10 2 3\n2 3 4 5 6 2 7 4 3 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">-1\n17\n25\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nFor the first test case, the answer is that the horse eats the first tree and has a break after the second jump.\nFor the second test case, the horse has breaks after the first and third jump and eats all trees.\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2019+Multi-University+Training+Contest+4&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2019 Multi-University Training Contest 4 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
