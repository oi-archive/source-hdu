Although she could put four 300mg weights on the medicine side and two 700mg weights on the other (Figure 2), she would not choose this solution because it is less convenient to use more weights.<br><br>You are asked to help her by calculating how many weights are required.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1356-1.gif\"></center><br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input is a sequence of datasets.
