You can delete all the characters or none, or only some of the characters.<br><br>He also teaches the pupils how to determine if a string is a subsequence of another string. For example, when you are asked to judge whether $\\text{wyh}$ is a subsequence of some string or not, you just need to find a character $\\text{w}$, a $\\text{y}$, and an $\\text{h}$, so that the $\\text{w}$ is in front of the $\\text{y}$, and the $\\text{y}$ is in front of the $\\text{h}$.<br><br>One day a pupil holding a string asks him, &quot;Is $\\text{wyh}$ a subsequence of this string?&quot;<br>However, wyh2000 has severe myopia. If there are two or more consecutive character $\\text{v}$s, then he would see it as one $\\text{w}$. For example, the string $\\text{vvv}$ will be seen as $\\text{w}$, the string $\\text{vvwvvv}$ will be seen as $\\text{www}$, and the string $\\text{vwvv}$ will be seen as $\\text{vww}$.<br><br>How would wyh2000 answer this question?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T(T\\le 10^5)$, denoting the number of testcases.<br><br>$N$ lines follow, each line contains a string.<br><br>Total string length will not exceed 3145728.
