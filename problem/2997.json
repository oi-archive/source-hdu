And I also remember, in that time, I was deeply attracted by a game called Chromatron.<br>Chromatron is a game all about reflections. Laser beams and many kinds of tools can be used in order to allow the pinwheels being hit by the correct lights that have the same color.<br>If you&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;ve played before, you will know that this game uses a very complicated (or you may say mysterious) way to store the current condition. If you press Ctrl+C on its interface and paste it somewhere, you will get code like &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;1-15-tJoIHWhNHAcgJnmxhCOx&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; which represents the first picture. And a question comes to my mind, what do those characters exactly mean?<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C270-1005-1.jpg\"></center> <br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C270-1005-2.jpg\"></center> <br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C270-1005-3.jpg\"></center><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C270-1005-4.jpg\"></center><br>After researching for a long time, I&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;ve finally got what I want.

The third part, tell the system how and where the tools are placed in the table.<br><br>But one question still remains, how does the tools being indicated?<br>In order to figure it out, I divide the string into several continuous units, two characters per unit.

Each line has two integers and a string S, two integers represents the position (x, y) which laser gun is being described.

If a laser hits a splitter at the correct angle, it bounces off at an angle (act exactly like a mirror) and also goes straight through. If it hits head on, it just goes through. Notice that the splitter is two-sided.<br>D : Doppler. The Doppler turns red beams into green, green into blue, and blue into red-or if you go through it backwards, the opposite. At the beginning, the forward direction is left to right.<br>P : Prism. A prism has two equal short face and a long face, act just like the third picture (Notice that white beam is consists by RGB together), and it reversible and symmetrical.<br>T : Teleporter. The teleporter causes laser beams to jump instantaneously to the next teleporter in the same direction as beam is travelling. If there&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s no teleporter in that direction, the beam disappears.<br>1 : Red Filter, that only allows red light go through, if the light is a mixed light that contains red light (like white laser), only red light left after passing (if it can pass through).<br>2 : Green Filter.<br>3 : Blue Filter.<br><br><br>Last line contains the string S as said before.<br>You can be sure that all inputs are legal.<br><br>At beginning, tools are initially placed as below:<br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C270-1005-6.jpg\"><br> <br>From left to right: A 2 3 1 S M D P<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"If it&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s a solution print &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Yes&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, otherwise print &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;No&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">...............\n...............\n............y..\n...............\n..r.......c....\n...............\n...............\nW...-.-w-.-b...\n...............\n.........m.....\n...g...........\n...............\n...............\n...............\n...............\n8 1 r\nAAAAA321SS\ntJoIHWhNHAcgJnmxhCOx\n\n...............\n...............\n...............\n....g..........\n.....b.....g...\n......r...b....\n.........r.....\nG..............\n.....r.........\n....b...r......\n...g.....b.....\n..........g....\n...............\n...............\n...............\n8 1 ru\nMMMMMMMMMMMDD\ncpHFIjypclcnHbynphnZoDOyEc\n\n*******W*******\n*******.*******\n......w........\n.*.**.*.*.**.*.\n.*...........*.\n.*.****.****.*.\n.*......w....*.\n.*.**.*.*.**.*.\n......*w*......\n.*.**.*.*.**.*.\n.*...........*.\n.*.****.****.*.\n...***...***...\n.*.**.*.*.**.*.\n...*r**g**b*...\n1 8 d\nMMMMAP\nNjcAtyiFCddq\n\n.......R.......\n...............\n...............\n...............\n...............\n...............\n...............\n.r.T.b.T.r.T.b.\n...............\n...............\n...............\n...............\n...............\n...............\n.......B.......\n1 8 d\n15 8 u\nAAAA\nDAhKdbxl</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Yes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nFour samples are corresponding to first four pictures.\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2009+Multi-University+Training+Contest+19+-+Host+by+BNU&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2009 Multi-University Training Contest 19 - Host by BNU </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
