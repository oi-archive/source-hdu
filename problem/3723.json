The delta wave of an otaku&apos;s brain can be approximated by a polygonal line in the 2D coordinate system. The line is a route from point (0, 0) to (N, 0), and it is allowed to move only to the right (up, down or straight) at every step. And during the whole moving, it is not allowed to dip below the y = 0 axis.<br><br>For example, there are the 9 kinds of delta waves for N = 4:<br><br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/3723-1.jpg\"></center><br><br><br>Given N, you are requested to find out how many kinds of different delta waves of otaku.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are no more than 20 test cases.
