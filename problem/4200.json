Although ninjas are excellent fighters, they primarily rely on stealth to complete their missions. However, many lights are turned on in the hallway, and this way it will not take long before Ryu is spotted by a guard. To remain unseen, Ryu will need to turn off all the lights as quickly as possible.<br>The hallway contains a sequence of n lights L1......Ln. Some of these lights are turned on. Destroy-ing the lights with his shurikens would be too loud, so he needs to turn them off the old-fashioned way, using light switches. Luckily, there is a switch box nearby with a light switch Si for every light Li. However, after trying one of the switches, he notices something funny. When he <br>ips the switch Si, it does not only turn on/off light Li, but also some of the neighboring lights. Ryu notices that there is a parameter D such that <br>ipping switch Si turns on/off all the lights L(i-D)......L(i+D), if they exist(This means that S1 turns on/off all the lights L1 ......L(D+1) and Sn turns on/off all the lights L(n-D)......Ln. Of course, if D&gt;=n, then L(D+1) and L(n-D) will not exist either.). Turning on or off lights can attract the attention of the guards, so Ryu would like to turn off all the lights with the minimum number of times <br>ipping a switch. Can you help him out?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains a single number: the number of test cases to follow.
