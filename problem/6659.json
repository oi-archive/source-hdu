Playing with interesting numbers is his favorite. Today, he finds a manuscript when cleaning his room, which reads<br><i><br>... Let $f(d, n)$ denote the number of occurrences of digit $d$ in decimal representations of integers $1, 2, 3, \\cdots, n$. The function has some fantastic properties ...<br><br>... Obviously, there exist some nonnegative integers $k$, such that $f(d, k) = k$, and I decide to call them $d$-good numbers ...<br><br>... I have found all $d$-good numbers not exceeding $10^{1000}$, but the paper is too small to write all these numbers ...<br></i><br>Acesrc quickly recollects all $d$-good numbers he found, and he tells Redsun a question about $d$-good numbers: what is the maximum $d$-good number no greater than $x$? However, Redsun is not good at mathematics, so he wants you to help him solve this problem.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input consists of a single integer $q$ $(1 \\leq q \\leq 1500)$, denoting the number of test cases.
