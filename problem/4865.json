He recorded a leaf humidity every day. There are four types of leaves wetness: Dry , Dryish , Damp and Soggy. As we know, the humidity of leaves is affected by the weather. And there are only three kinds of weather: Sunny, Cloudy and  Rainy.For example, under Sunny conditions, the possibility of leaves are dry is 0.6.<br>   Give you the possibility list of weather to the humidity of leaves.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C502-1005-1.jpg\"></center> <br>   The weather today is affected by the weather yesterday. For example, if yesterday is Sunny, the possibility of today cloudy is 0.375.<br>   The relationship between weather today and weather yesterday is following by table:<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C502-1005-2.jpg\"></center> <br>   Now,Peter has some recodes of the humidity of leaves in N days.And we know the weather conditons on the first day : the probability of sunny is 0.63,the probability of cloudy is 0.17,the probability of rainny is 0.2.Could you know the weathers of these days most probably like in order?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"   The first line is T, means the number of cases, then the followings are T cases. for each case:<br>   The first line is a integer n(n&lt;=50),means the number of days, and the next n lines, each line is a string shows the humidity  of leaves (Dry, Dryish, Damp, Soggy)","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"   For each test case, print the case number on its own line.
