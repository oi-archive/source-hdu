Gods always tell the truth whereas devils sometimes tell the truth but sometimes not. What&apos;s more, every god and devil knows all the others are a god or a devil. <br>One day, an accident unfortunately happened which made echo lose her memory. She was so despairing and determined to turn to others for help. She asked all the residents a question, but all of the answers were merely &quot;Be careful! X is a devil!&quot;. As a result she failed to arouse her memory. However, she has to find out a method to calculate the minimum number of devils on the island. Could you help echo to manage it well?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multi-cases (The total number of cases won&apos;t exceed 20).
