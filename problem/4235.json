The number 136948 has the same property: 136948=146*938.<br>Such numbers are called Vampire Numbers. More precisely, a number v is a Vampire Number if it has a pair of factors, a and b, where a*b=v, and together, a and b have exactly the same digits, in exactly the same quantities, as v. None of the numbers v, a or b can have leading zeros. The mathematical definition says that v should have an even number of digits and that a and b should have the same number of digits, but for the purposes of this problem, we&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;ll relax that requirement, and allow a and b to have differing numbers of digits, and v to have any number of digits. Here are some more examples:<br>126 = 6 * 21<br>10251 = 51 * 201<br>702189 = 9 * 78021<br>29632 = 32 * 926<br>Given a number X, find the smallest Vampire Number which is greater than or equal to X.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There will be several test cases in the input.
