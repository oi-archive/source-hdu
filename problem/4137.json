In this one, you&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;re given a sequence S of N distinct integers and are asked to sort it with minimum cost using only one operation:<br><i>The Manhattan swap!</i><br>Let Si and Sj be two elements of the sequence at positions i and j respectively, applying the Manhattan swap operation to Si and Sj swaps both elements with a cost of |i-j|. For example, given the sequence {9,5,3}, we can sort the sequence with a single Manhattan swap operation by swapping the first and last elements for a total cost of 2 (absolute difference between positions of 9 and 3).","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of 2 lines. The first line consists of a single integer (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 30), the length of the sequence S. The second line contains N space separated integers representing the elements of S. All sequence elements are distinct and fit in 32 bit signed integer.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one line containing a single integer, the minimum cost of sorting the sequence using only the Manhattan swap operation.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n3\n9 5 3\n6\n6 5 4 3 2 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 2\nCase #2: 9</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=The+Third+Lebanese+Collegiate+Programming+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> The Third Lebanese Collegiate Programming Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
