In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.<br><br>You find a partial tree on the way home. This tree has $n$ nodes but lacks of $n-1$ edges. You want to complete this tree by adding $n-1$ edges. There must be exactly one path between any two nodes after adding. As you know, there are $n^{n-2}$ ways to complete this tree, and you want to make the completed tree as cool as possible. The coolness of a tree is the sum of coolness of its nodes. The coolness of a node is $f(d)$, where $f$ is a predefined function and $d$ is the degree of this node. What&apos;s the maximum coolness of the completed tree?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer $T$ indicating the total number of test cases.<br>Each test case starts with an integer $n$ in one line,<br>then one line with $n - 1$ integers $f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(n-1)$.<br><br>$1 \\le T \\le 2015$<br>$2 \\le n \\le 2015$<br>$0 \\le f(i) \\le 10000$<br>There are at most $10$ test cases with $n &gt; 100$.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, please output the maximum coolness of the completed tree in one line.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n3\n2 1\n4\n5 1 4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5\n19</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2015ACM%2FICPC%D1%C7%D6%DE%C7%F8%B3%A4%B4%BA%D5%BE-%D6%D8%CF%D6%C8%FC%A3%A8%B8%D0%D0%BB%B6%AB%B1%B1%CA%A6%B4%F3%A3%A9&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2015ACM/ICPC&#x4E9A;&#x6D32;&#x533A;&#x957F;&#x6625;&#x7AD9;-&#x91CD;&#x73B0;&#x8D5B;&#xFF08;&#x611F;&#x8C22;&#x4E1C;&#x5317;&#x5E08;&#x5927;&#xFF09; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
