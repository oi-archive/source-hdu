There are three most important ways in which the vertices of a binary tree can be systematically traversed or ordered. They are preorder, inorder and postorder. Let T be a binary tree with root r and subtrees T1,T2.<br><br>In a preorder traversal of the vertices of T, we visit the root r followed by visiting the vertices of T1 in preorder, then the vertices of T2 in preorder.<br><br>In an inorder traversal of the vertices of T, we visit the vertices of T1 in inorder, then the root r, followed by the vertices of T2 in inorder.<br><br>In a postorder traversal of the vertices of T, we visit the vertices of T1 in postorder, then the vertices of T2 in postorder and finally we visit r.<br><br>Now you are given the preorder sequence and inorder sequence of a certain binary tree. Try to find out its postorder sequence.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/C57-1005-1.jpg\"></center>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases.
