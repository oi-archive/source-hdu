There is a hidden array of size $2 \\times N$ containing a permutation of $1 \\sim 2 \\times N$.<br><br>There is an empty set. Initially, the first $N$ integers of this array are inserted into the set.  Then, there are $N$ operations performed. The $i$-th operation is one of the following two actions:<br><br>1. take out the LARGEST number from the set, and then insert the $(i+N)$-th number from the array into the set. <br><br>2. take out the SMALLEST number from the set, and then insert the $(i+N)$-th number from the array into the set.<br><br>For each operation, you only know which action is taken and what&apos;s the number taken out from the set.<br><br>Please find out the content of the hidden array based on the given information. If there are many possible such arrays, you must output the lexicographically smallest one.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer $T$ indicating there are $T$ tests.<br><br>Each test consists of two lines. the first line contains one positive integer $N$ indicating that the size of the hidden array is $2 \\times N$.

For the $i$-th operation, the LARGEST number with value $b_i$ is taken out from the set if $b_i$ is positive; Otherwise, $b_i$ is negative which means the SMALLEST number with value $-b_i$ is taken out from the set in the $i$-th operation.<br><br>* $1 \\le T \\le 5 \\times 10^5$<br><br>* $1 \\le N \\le 5 \\times 10^4$<br><br>* sum of all $N$ across tests $\\le 5 \\times 10^5$<br><br>* $-2 \\times N \\le b_i \\le 2 \\times N$<br><br>* $|b_i|$ are all distinct in a test","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test, if it&apos;s impossible to recover such array, output a single integer $-1$ in a line.
