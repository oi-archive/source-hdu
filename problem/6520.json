The teacher gave her a part formed by the intersection of several prisms and asked her to find the volume of the part. But her brain doesn&apos;t work that she can&apos;t finish the work even in very simple cases. Therefore, she urgently needs your help.<br><br>To simplify the problem, the part is formed by the intersection of two infinitely long convex right prisms A and B. All joining edges of A are parallel to the $z$-axis, and all joining edges of B are parallel to the $x$-axis. If A and B do not intersect, Keke&apos;s teacher thinks that the part has a volume of 0.<br><br>Now Keke wants you to help her find the volume of the part.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are mutiple test cases, the number of which is no more than 10.
