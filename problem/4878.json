In order to examine ZCC, GPS created a software. This software works as follow. A user inputs a string S which <b>only consists of uppercase</b> into this software, then the software calculates the score which string S has by using its strange methods.Initially the software stores n different words and the initial score is 1. The length of S is L. The chars of string S is labeled from 1 to L(left to right), and S[i] represent the i-th char of S. <br><br>// Prime[k] means the k-th prime number, such as Prime[1]=2, Prime[2]=3 ,Prime[8]=19.<br>Input &gt;&gt; S<br>Score = 1<br>For i = 1 to L do<br>  For k=1 to n do<br>    If  S[j..i]  equals to  Word[k]<br>       Score = Score * Prime[k] * ( i * 2 - j + 1 )<br>Output &lt;&lt; Score<br><br>   The pseudocode above shows when input S what score we can get.<br>     If  n=2,L=3,Word[1]=&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;AB&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;,Word[2]=&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;BB&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; then <br>Score[ABB] = 1 * ( 2 * 2 - 1 + 1 ) * Prime[1] * ( 3 * 2 - 2 + 1 ) * Prime[2],<br>Score[CBA] = 1,<br>Score[CAB] = 1 * ( 3 * 2 - 2 + 1 ) * Prime[1];<br>   ZCC has found a BUG which can help him to input strings into the software as much as he can. And the score he gets in the end is <b>the sum of the score he gets in each input</b>.ZCC wants to know the score he will get in the end, if he input <b>all the different strings</b> into the software. That is to say if the length of string is L, he can input 26^L strings in all. The answer can be very large, so what ZCC actually want is the ans Mod 5047621.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The input contains several test cases.Two integers N(1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;N&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;40),L(1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;L&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;10^17) will exist in the first line of each input, indicating the number of words and the length of each S you can input to the software.
