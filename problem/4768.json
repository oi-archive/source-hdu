Different kinds of student societies are all trying to advertise themselves, by giving flyers to the students for introducing the society. However, due to the fund shortage, the flyers of a society can only be distributed to a part of the students. There are too many, too many students in our university, labeled from 1 to 2^32. And there are totally N student societies, where the i-th society will deliver flyers to the students with label A_i, A_i+C_i,A_i+2*C_i,&#x2026;A_i+k*C_i (A_i+k*C_i&lt;=B_i, A_i+(k+1)*C_i&gt;B_i). We call a student &quot;unlucky&quot; if he/she gets odd pieces of flyers. Unfortunately, not everyone is lucky. Yet, no worries; there is at most one student who is unlucky. Could you help us find out who the unfortunate dude (if any) is? So that we can comfort him by treating him to a big meal!<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
