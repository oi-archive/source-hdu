Even using a modern computer, a straight forward implementation for the calculations may take very long time to complete! And this is where we seek your help as a brilliant computer scientist!","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains an integer (1 &lt;= T &lt;= 200), the number of test cases.<br>T test cases follow, the first line of each test case contains two integers (1 &lt;= N, M&lt;= 110,000), the lengths of sequences A and B respectively.
