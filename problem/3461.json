The lock contains a sequence of wheels. Each wheel has the 26 letters of the English alphabet &apos;a&apos; through &apos;z&apos;, in order. If you move a wheel up, the letter it shows changes to the next letter in the English alphabet (if it was showing the last letter &apos;z&apos;, then it changes to &apos;a&apos;).<br>At each operation, you are only allowed to move some specific subsequence of contiguous wheels up. This has the same effect of moving each of the wheels up within the subsequence.<br>If a lock can change to another after a sequence of operations, we regard them as same lock. Find out how many different locks exist?<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases in the input.<br><br>Each test case begin with two integers N (1&lt;=N&lt;=10000000) and M (0&lt;=M&lt;=1000) indicating the length of the code system and the number of legal operations. <br>Then M lines follows.
