He&apos;s a mathematician who demonstrated an image transformation method called arnold transformation, which could shuffle all pixels in  an image, and after a serials of this transformation, the image would be transformed to  its original form.<br>The transformation method is quite simple. For a given image with  N &#xD7;  N pixels  (Width and height are both equal to N), a pixel at location (x, y) will be shuffled to  location ( (x + y) % N , (x + 2 &#xD7; y) % N ) (0 &#x2264; x &lt; N, 0 &#x2264; y &lt; N). In one step of  transformation, all  N &#xD7;  N pixels will be shuffled to new corresponding location,  making the image a chaotic one. You can do the transformation as many times as you  can.<br>The arnold transformation is very interesting. For every image of size  N &#xD7;  N, after  finite steps of transformation, the image will become exact the same as the original  one. The minimum number of steps which make every possible image become the  same as origin will be called as period of arnold transformation. For a given N, can  you calculate the period?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There will be about 200 test cases.
