There are N-1 edges. Players alternate in making moves, Alice moves first. A move consists of two steps. In the first step the player selects an edge and removes it from the tree. In the second step he/she removes all the edges that are no longer connected to the root. The player who has no edge to remove loses.<br>You may assume that both Alice and Bob play optimally.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input file contains an integer T (T&lt;=100) specifying the number of test cases. <br>Each test case begins with a line containing an integer N (1&lt;=N&lt;=10^5), the number of vertices,The following N-1 lines each contain two integers I , J, which means I is connected with J.
