He calculate the answer in this way : <br>Answer =  (r + 8) / 11 &#x2013; (l &#x2013; 1 + 8) / 11.<br><br>Rukaw heard of Hanamichi&#x2019;s solution from you and he proved there is something wrong with Hanamichi&#x2019;s solution. So he decided to change the test data so that Hanamichi&#x2019;s solution can not pass any single test. And he asks you to do that for him.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"You are given a integer T (1 &#x2264; T &#x2264; 100), which tells how many single tests the final test data has.
