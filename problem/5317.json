He wants to find more and more interesting things about GCD. Today He comes up with Range Greatest Common Divisor Query (RGCDQ). What&#x2019;s RGCDQ? Please let me explain it to you gradually. For a positive integer x, F(x) indicates the number of kind of prime factor of x. For example F(2)=1. F(10)=2, because 10=2*5. F(12)=2, because 12=2*2*3, there are two kinds of prime factor. For each query, we will get an interval [L, R], Hdu wants to know $\\max GCD(F(i),F(j))$   $(L\\leq i&lt;j\\leq R) $","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple queries.
