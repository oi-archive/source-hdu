He finds it so interesting that he can&apos;t stop playing with his strings. These days he has just learnt about palindrome, and comes up with a problem about it.<br><br>Given two integers, $N$ and $M$, he wants to construct a string of length $N$, whose substrings contain exactly $M$ distinct non-empty palindromes. A palindrome is a string which is exactly the same as the reverse of itself. For example, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;ABBA&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;ADA&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;A&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, and &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;UUSSUU&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; are palindromes, but &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;USTC&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;AB&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, and &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;ABC&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; are not. A substring is a consecutive part of the original string. For example, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;US&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;USTC&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;STC&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, and &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;TC&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; are substrings of &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;USTC&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, but &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;UC&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; and &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;CT&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; are not.<br><br>Frog finds it too hard for him to solve this problem. So he asks you for help. BTW, he won&apos;t make it too easy for you, so he decided to ask you solve this problem under his restrictions. You can only use the first $K$ capital letters in the English alphabet $(A-Z)$. Please write a program to solve this problem.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There is an integer $T$ in the first line indicating the number of total test cases.

If there is no such string satisfying Frog&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s requirements, output &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<b>Impossible</b>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; instead.
