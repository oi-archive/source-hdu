They&#x2019;ve prepared N problems with estimated difficulty score in range [ $A_i , B_i$ ]. TopHoster would like to host a contest consisting of M problems.<br>The $i^{th}$ problem should be of difficulty score $C_i$. The $i^{th}$ problem from TopSetter can be used in the contest if and only if its estimated difficulty score range $[A_i, B_i]$ covers the difficulty score c of its target problem in the contest, i.e. $A_i &#x2264; c &#x2264; B_i$ . Hosting a contest with M problems needs tohave M distinct problems which satisfy the required difficulty scores for each problem.<br>Unfortunately, TopSetter doesn&#x2019;t provide a service to buy specific problems. You can only request a problem set containing K problems and they will give you K distinct problems from all the N problems, but you don&#x2019;t know which problems will be given.<br>As TopSetter is the only problem provider for TopHoster, TopHoster would like to know the least number K of problems they need to buy to make sure they can host a contest.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T.
