Now he has a lot of homework to do. Every teacher gives him a deadline of handing in the homework. If Ignatius hands in the homework after the deadline, the teacher will reduce his score of the final test, 1 day for 1 point. And as you know, doing homework always takes a long time. So Ignatius wants you to help him to arrange the order of doing homework to minimize the reduced score.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input is a single integer T which is the number of test cases. T test cases follow.<br>Each test case start with a positive integer N(1&lt;=N&lt;=15) which indicate the number of homework. Then N lines follow. Each line contains a string S(the subject&apos;s name, each string will at most has 100 characters) and two integers D(the deadline of the subject), C(how many days will it take Ignatius to finish this subject&apos;s homework). <br><br>Note: All the subject names are given in the alphabet increasing order. So you may process the problem much easier.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, you should output the smallest total reduced score, then give out the order of the subjects, one subject in a line.
