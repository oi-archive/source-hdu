It also implies that a person has chosen to take responsibility for their own health and well being, rather than entirely surrender that faculty to another. Consider several different herbs. Each of them has a certain time which needs to be gathered, to be prepared and to be processed. Meanwhile a detailed analysis presents scores as evaluations of each herbs. Our time is running out. The only goal is to maximize the sum of scores for herbs which we can get within a limited time.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are at most ten test cases.<br>For each case, the first line consists two integers, the total number of different herbs and the time limit.<br>The $i$-th line of the following $n$ line consists two non-negative integers.
