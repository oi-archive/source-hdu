This is not a computational geometry problem. <br><br>Carol and Dave are playing a game with this points. (Why not Alice and Bob? Well, perhaps they are bored. ) Starting from no edges, the two players play in turn by drawing one edge in each move. Carol plays first. An edge means a line segment connecting two different points. The edges they draw cannot have common points. <br><br>To make this problem a bit easier for some of you, they are simutaneously playing on N planes. In each turn, the player select a plane and makes move in it. If a player cannot move in any of the planes, s/he loses. <br><br>Given N and all n&apos;s, determine which player will win. <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"First line, number of test cases, T. <br>Following are 2*T lines.
