Dating back to the time of chaos, the prototype of Cyber Stone and all possible operations were recorded in an amazing way in an ancient book in now a secret library in Hogwarts. The authors of the records may be elements or spirits, however, without any convincingly evidence. Though the beginning that the products&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; becoming fashionable in the Muggle World is only after the Industrial Revolution.<br>The Cyber Stone can be described with a cube sized NxNxN. Each of the unit cubes can be visible or invisible, and is initially visible. <br>We know a normal cube has 6 surfaces, and can be pictured in a 3D Cartesian Coordinate System (aka an XYZ coordinate system). For convention, we name every unit cube its 3D axis (x, y, z) (0&lt;=x,y,z&lt;n). And every time we call the surface &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;the front surface&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, if it parallels with YOZ plane and has non-zero X axis. And the surface with the name &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;the back surface&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; is the surface parallel to the front surface. And if we are going to describe a rectangle in one of the 6 surfaces, because all points in the same surface have one axis in common, we only give the other two axis of one point ordering by (x,y) (y,z) or (z,x)<br>For example, if we have a Cyber Stone sized NxNxN, we describe a rectangle of (N-1, 1, 3) &#xFFFD;C (N-1, 2, 4) as (1,3)-(2,4) in &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;front surface&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;.<br>The surfaces we will mention are only the front and the back surface.<br>The axis and directions in rotating we will use are one of the six symbols: x+, x-, y+, y-, z+, z-. The symbol &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;y+&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; makes a sense of the axis of rotating is the Y-axis and we rotate counterclockwise. <br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C360-1003-1.jpg\"></center>  <br>Every time Harry could do one of following operations with a few effort of his magic (of course Muggles can and can only use computers to play like playing an virtual game):<br>1.&#xA0;&#xA0;Rotate in one of all 6 directions. This operation is called &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Rotate&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;.(The direction symbol can be x+, x-, y+, y-, z+, z-, )<br>2.&#xA0;&#xA0;Choose a rectangle (a,b)-(c,d), then make all visible unit cube, between (a, b)-(c,d) in the front surface and in the back surface(inclusive), invisible. This operation is called &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Remove&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<br>3.&#xA0;&#xA0;Choose a rectangle (a,b)-(c,d), then make all invisible unit cube, between (a, b)-(c,d) in the front surface and in the back surface(inclusive), visible. This operation is called &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Resume&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<br>4.&#xA0;&#xA0;Choose a rectangle (a,b)-(c,d), then make all unit cube, between (a, b)-(c,d) in the front surface and in the back surface(inclusive), change its visible state(i.e if it is visible then it&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s changed to invisible and the other way around) . This operation is called &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Reverse&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<br>In order to describe the result Harry gets, we have:<br>5.&#xA0;&#xA0;Draw a picture with the aspect of standing in the front and seeing through the front surface to the back.
