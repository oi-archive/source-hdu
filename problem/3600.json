Some days ago, he played the eight digits puzzle, and he thought it&#x2019;s so easy. Then he want to challenge a N*N-1 digits puzzle whose rules are same with the eight digits puzzle. Firstly he have all the numbers from 0 to N*N-1 arranged in N rows and N columns randomly. Because he don&#x2019;t want to waste time, he hope to make sure whether he can finally solve the puzzle if he is clever enough. Now he ask you for help.<br>(Ps. Don&#x2019;t you know the eight digits puzzle? Oh, my god! Let me tell you: you have all numbers from 0 to 8 arranged in 3 rows and 3 columns. You are allowed to switch two adjacent elements (horizontally or vertically), only if one of them has the value 0. You have to decide whether there exists a sequence of moves which brings the puzzle in the initial state into the final state.)<br>In this puzzle , we will give you a initial state, and we set the final state is:<br> 1  2  3  4 <br> 5  6  7  8 <br> 9 10 11 12 <br>13 14 15  0<br>(n=4 for example)","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Each case starts with a line contains the integer N.<br>The following N lines describe the initial state, each of them containing n integers, describing the initial state of the puzzle.<br>A line with N = 0 indicates the end of the input; do not write any output for this case.
