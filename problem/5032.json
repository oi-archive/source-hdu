The field can be considered as a 1000 * 1000 grid where mushrooms are grown in grid points numbered from (1, 1) to (1000, 1000). Because of humidity and sunshine, the productions in different grid points are not the same. Further, the production in the grid points (x, y) is (x + A)(y + B) where A, B are two constant. <br><br>   Matt,the owner of ACM has some queries where he wants to know the sum of the productions in a given scope(include the mushroom growing on the boundary). In each query, the scope Matt asks is a right angled triangle whose apexes are (0, 0), (p, 0), (p, q) 1&lt;=p, q&lt;=1000. <br><br>   As the employee of ACM, can you answer Matt&#x2019;s queries?
