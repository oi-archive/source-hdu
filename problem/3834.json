The table&apos;s surface is so smooth that I can move without energy lost.<br>Now you are to give me a hit vector, I want to know where I will be after T seconds. Collisions between me and the edge of the table satisfy Conservation of Momentum Theorem , also my speed after collision is as fast as before. Look for the figure below to know it more clearly:<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C351-1007-1.png\"></center> ","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a number N, the number of test cases you have to proceed.<br>Each test case has three lines.First line has three numbers, x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>,r<sub>1</sub>, the center and radius of the table. Second line has x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>,r<sub>2</sub>, the parameters of me (the ball). The third line consists of dx, dy, T: (dx,dy) is the hit vector, T is the time I have moved since you hit me. To explain hit vector: if I am at position (x<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub>) now ,next second I will be at position (x<sub>0</sub>+dx,y<sub>0</sub>+dy) without conllision. All input numbers are non-negative integer and less than 10^6.Also you can assume the ball must be in the table.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Please output two float number x , y,which mean the center position of the ball after T seconds and round to just one decimal places.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n5 5 10\n5 5 1\n1 0 30\n1 1 10\n1 0 2\n1 1 100</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">-1.0 5.0\n3.4 -0.5</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2011+Multi-University+Training+Contest+1+-+Host+by+HNU&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2011 Multi-University Training Contest 1 - Host by HNU </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
