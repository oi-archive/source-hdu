Fortunately, there is always a convenient way to deal with. You can replace your computer and get a brand new one, thus saving some maintenance cost. Of course, you must pay a fixed cost for each new computer you get.<br><br>Suppose you are considering an n year period over which you want to have a computer. Suppose you buy a new computer in year y, 1&lt;=y&lt;=n Then you have to pay a fixed cost c, in the year y, and a maintenance cost m(y,z) each year you own that computer, starting from year y through the year z, z&lt;=n, when you plan to buy - eventually - another computer.<br><br>Write a program that computes the minimum cost of having a computer over the n year period.<br><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The program input is from a text file.
