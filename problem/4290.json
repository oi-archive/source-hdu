In each cell, you can place one icon of an application of a certain type. Your applications can be of one of K types, numbered 1 through K. You&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;re an expert in this filed, so it is assumed that there is an unlimited number of applications of each type.<br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Any placement is called an icon formation. Some of the icon formations are beautiful. An icon formation is called beautiful if and only if no pair of rows are similar. Two rows are similar if and only if for each X that 1 &lt;= X &lt;= K, they contain exactly the same number of applications of type X.<br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;GivenN,M, andK, you should solve for the number of different icon formations that are beautiful, modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7.
