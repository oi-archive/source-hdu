The $0^\\mathrm{th}$ problem in the contest is as follows.<br><br>There are two balls that weigh $a$ kg and $b$ kg respectively. They can be regarded as particles in this problem, as they are small enough. At the very beginning (i.e. $t = 0$), the distance between two balls is $d$ km, and both of them are not moving.<br><br>Assuming that only gravitation works in this system (no other objects or other forces considered). The two balls has started moving since $t = 0$. Your task is to calculate the distance between them when $t = t_0$ (s).<br><br>Help Zhang3 solve the problem!<br><br><br><br>The following information might help when solving the problem.<br><br>- Universal gravitation formula: $F = G \\cdot m_1 \\cdot m_2 / r ^ 2$<br><br>- Gravitational constant: $G = 6.67430 \\times 10^{-11} \\; \\mathrm{m}^3 / (\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^2)$<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input gives the number of test cases $T \\; (1 \\le T \\le 100)$. $T$ test cases follow.<br><br>For each test case, the only line contains four integers $a, b, d, t_0 \\; (1 \\le a, b, d, t_0 \\le 100)$, representing the mass of the two balls, the initial distance between them, and how much time the balls move.<br><br>It is guaranteed that two balls will not collide within $(t_0 + 1)$ seconds.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print a line with a real number $x$, representing that the distance is $x$ km.<br><br>Your answers should have absolute or relative errors of at most $10^{-6}$.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n1 2 3 4\n7 73 7 68\n100 100 1 100</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2.99999999999999999982\n6.99999999999999974807\n0.99999999999993325700</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2020+Multi-University+Training+Contest+4&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2020 Multi-University Training Contest 4 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
