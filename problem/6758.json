So she now needs assistance of you &#x2013; a talented programmer. The problem is as below.<br><br>Given a positive integer N, calculate the following value:<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C879-1008-1.png\"></center><br>We can prove that it is a rational number. Let&#x2019;s denote it by $Q/P$, where gcd(P,Q)=1 and P,Q&gt;0. Since these numbers can be very huge for large N, you are only to print the value $Q \\cdot P^{-1}$ mod ($10^9$+9). Here $P^{-1}$ is multiplicative inverse of P modulo $10^9$+9.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains a single integer T(1&#x2264;T&#x2264;$10^5$), the number of test cases. <br><br>Each of the next T lines contains an integer N(1&#x2264;N&#x2264;$10^5$ ), which is described above.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, you should print the answer in a single line.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">400000006</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2020+Multi-University+Training+Contest+1&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2020 Multi-University Training Contest 1 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
