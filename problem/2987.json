In this problem we are looking for permutations with special properties: <br><br>1. Antimonotonic: for each consecutive 3 values p<sub>i-1</sub>, p<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>i+1</sub> (1 &lt; i &lt; n), p<sub>i</sub> should either be the smallest or the biggest of the three values. <br>2. Cyclic: The permutation should consist of only one cycle, that is, when we use p<sub>i</sub> as a pointer from i to p<sub>i</sub>, it should be possible to start at position 1 and follow the pointers and reach all n positions before returning to position 1. <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file contains several test cases.
