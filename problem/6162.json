After a whole night tossing and turning, he decides to get to his girl friend&apos;s city and of course, with well-chosen gifts. He knows neither too low the price could a gift be since his girl friend won&apos;t like it, nor too high of it since he might consider not worth to do. So he will only buy gifts whose price is between [a,b].<br>There are n cities in the country and (n-1) bi-directional roads. Each city can be reached from any other city. In the ith city, there is a specialty of price ci Cui could buy as a gift. Cui buy at most 1 gift in a city. Cui starts his trip from city s and his girl friend is in city t.
