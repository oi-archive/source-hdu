The town was so small and narrow that he can regard the town as a pivot. There were some skyscrapers in the town, each located at position x<sub>i</sub> with its height h<sub>i</sub>. All skyscrapers located in different place. The skyscrapers had no width, to make it simple. As the skyscrapers were so high, Matt could hardly see the sky.Given the position Matt was at, he wanted to know how large the angle range was where he could see the sky. Assume that Matt&apos;s height is 0. It&apos;s guaranteed that for each query, there is at least one building on both Matt&apos;s left and right, and no building locate at his position.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of testcases.
