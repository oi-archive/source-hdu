And the teams are given 5 hours to solve between 8 and 12 programming problems. <br><br>   On Mars, there is programming contest, too. Each team consist of N students. The teams are given M hours to solve M programming problems. Each team can use only one computer, but they can&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t cooperate to solve a problem. At the beginning of the ith hour, they will get the ith programming problem. They must choose a student to solve this problem and others go out to have a rest. The chosen student will spend an hour time to program this problem. At the end of this hour, he must submit his program. This program is then run on test data and can&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t modify any more. <br><br>   Now, you have to help a team to find a strategy to maximize the expected number of correctly solved problems. <br><br>   For each problem, each student has a certain probability that correct solve. If the i<sup>th</sup> student solve the j<sup>th</sup> problem, the probability of correct solve is P<sub>ij</sub> .<br><br>   At any time, the different between any two students&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; programming time is not more than 1 hour. For example, if there are 3 students and there are 5 problems. The strategy {1,2,3,1,2}, {1,3,2,2,3} or {2,1,3,3,1} are all legal. But {1,1,3,2,3},{3,1,3,1,2} and {1,2,3,1,1} are all illegal. <br><br>   You should find a strategy to maximize the expected number of correctly solved problems, if you have know all probability","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The first line of the input is T (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; T &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 20), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.<br><br>   The first line of each case contains two integers N ,M (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 10,1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; M &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 1000),denoting the number of students and programming problem, respectively.<br><br>   The next N lines, each lines contains M real numbers between 0 and 1 , the j<sup>th</sup> number in the i<sup>th</sup> line is P<sub>ij</sub> .","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"   For each test case, print a line &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Case #t: &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;(without quotes, t means the index of the test case) at the beginning.
