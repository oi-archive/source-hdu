Felicia felt bad about that and he wants to light up all the lanterns. There is a kind of magic switch which can change the states of k continuous lanterns. Once you choose k continuous lanterns and install a switch on them, the states of all k continuous lanterns can be changed together (on -&gt;off or off -&gt;on), but you cannot choose some ones be changed and some ones not be changed.<br>Felicia wants to buy as few switches as possible so that he can install them to turn on all the lanterns. Please notice that each switch must control exactly k continuous lanterns.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of each case contains integers n(0 &lt; n &lt;= 100000), which is the length of that string of fancy lanterns, and k(0 &lt;= k &lt;= n), which is the number of continuous lanterns that a switch will control. The next line consists of a string of &#x201C;01&#x201D; with length n. &#x201C;1&#x201D; means that lantern is on and &#x201C;0&#x201D; means off.
