Due to its powerful function in code complete, compile, and error jump, it&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s widely used by programmers. The same as Emacs, it&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s the most popular text editor among users of UNIX. As such an excellent text editor, Vim has various of orders. Now, we&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;re asking you to write a program that simulates Vim&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s replace order.<br><br>The format of Vim&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s replace order is ([] means optional, {} means necessary) :<br><br>    :[range]s/{pattern}/{string}/[flag]<br><br>In the order above,<br><br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;:&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; means the start of a replace order,<br><br>[range] indicates the range of the order, that is, the order works in which lines.<br><br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; is short for substitute.<br><br>{pattern} and {string} represent the string to match and replace to, respectively.<br><br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;/&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; is used to mark the beginning and ending of {pattern} and {string}.<br><br>{flag} is used to open or close some options.<br><br>{range} is often two integers separated by a comma, indicating the start line and end line&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s line number.<br><br>For example, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;4,8&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; means from line 4 to line 8 (including line 4, line 8). Line number starts from 1. You can also use a &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;%&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; to represent all lines.<br><br>(Additional, Vim provides many more flexible formats. Such as, bypassing a number means the line cursor stays, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;$&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; means the last line of the text. So, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;,$&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; means from the line cursor stays to the last line. )<br><br>{pattern} and {string} both support regular expression (if you haven&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t ever heard of it, go to Google for help). If {pattern} is empty, the {pattern} of the last replace order will be used.<br><br>Obviously, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;/&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; can&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t be included in {pattern} and {string}. So, an additional escape character &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;\\&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; is used. For example, if you want to replace &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&lt;br&gt;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; to &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&lt;br/&gt;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, you cannot write:<br><br>    :%s/&lt;br&gt;/&lt;br /&gt;/g<br><br>Instead, you should write:<br><br>    :%s/&lt;br&gt;/&lt;br \\/&gt;/g<br><br>If there&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;re too many &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;/&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s in the expression, (for instance, &quot;file:///usr/share/man/man1/vim.1.gz&quot;), it will become troublesome. So, people think of a solution, that is, use another character as the separator (the first character after &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; is always treated as the separator). For example, when using &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;+&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; as the separator, the order above can be written this way:<br><br>    :%s+&lt;br&gt;+&lt;br /&gt;+g<br><br>There&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;re many kinds of [flag]. &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;g&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; means replace every time it matches. Without a &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;g&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, it will only replace the first matching string. For example:<br><br>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br><br>Execute the order bellow:<br><br>    :%s/i//g<br><br>Result is:<br><br>    #nclude &lt;stdo.h&gt;<br><br>While executing this order bellow:<br><br>    :%s/i//<br><br>Result is:<br><br>    #nclude &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br><br>Other flags including: &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;c&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; indicates a confirm is required before every replacement, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;i&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; indicates case insensitive.<br><br>Here comes a problem, what if you want to replace &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;a&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; to &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;aa&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;? Somebody may doubt that it will go to an endless loop, but in fact, it won&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t. Because there is a rule that, in a replacement, the replaced characters can&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t be replaced again. So, if you want to replace &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;a&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; to &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;aa&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, it&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s in fact that every successive &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;a&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; string is doubled in length.<br><br>To simplify the problem, we make some appointments:<br><br>1.       [range] must appear, in the form of &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;%&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; or &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;a,b&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; (a, b are both integers, and a&lt;=b)<br><br>2.       {pattern} and {string} are both consist of characters, numbers, spaces and &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;_&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; (not including any separator below, so an escape character is not needed)<br><br>3.       You can choose one of these characters as the separator: /~!@#$%^&amp;*()-+=<br><br>4.       [flag] is always a &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;g&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<br><br>A big example:<br><br>Original text:<br><br>    If the Tao is greet, then the operating system is greet.<br><br>    If the operating system is greeter, then the compiler is greet.<br><br>    If the compiler is greeter, then the applications is greet.<br><br>    The user is pleased and there is harmony in the world.<br><br>Replace order:<br><br>    :[1,4]s/greet/great/g<br><br>Or:<br><br>    :%s+greet+great+g<br><br>Either will replace the original text to:<br><br>    If the Tao is great, then the operating system is great.<br><br>    If the operating system is greater, then the compiler is great.<br><br>    If the compiler is greater, then the applications is great.<br><br>    The user is pleased and there is harmony in the world.<br><br>Please write a program to simulate this simplified vim replace order.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input will consist of one case.<br><br>The first line will be a positive integer L (L &lt;= 100), specifying the number of lines to be processed.
