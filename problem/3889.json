However, he thought it was worthless to practice that much since that after solving several problems, the rest was just repeating and repeating, which is too simple, sometimes naive. Therefore, he wanted someone to help him write a program, which would output all the results he needs immediately instead of calculating them himself.<br><br>The statistic problems might include z-scores, one-sample t-tests, correlation and regression.<br><br>For a population of real numbers, the standard deviation (SD) of the numbers is defined as <center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C354-1011-1.jpg\"></center> , where n is the number of the numbers, and Mx is the mean value of the numbers. The z-score for each number is defined as <center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/1011-2.jpg\"></center> .<br>You know, sometimes (almost always) we cannot get data for a whole population, and what we&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;ve got is just a sample from it. For a sample from a population, the SD is <center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C354-1011-3.jpg\"></center> , while the standard error (SE) is <center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/1011-4.jpg\"></center> . In a one-sample t-test, the t-value is defined as <center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/1011-5.jpg\"></center> .<br><br>There are many ways to calculate a correlation coefficient between two variables X and Y, and one of the most popular one is Pearson&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s r, which is <center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/1011-6.jpg\"></center> . Note that the SDs here are population SDs.<br>It is a little complicated for regression, which is meant to find the &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;best&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; a and b for the estimation <center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/1011-7.jpg\"></center> . Here <center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/1011-8.jpg\"></center> , and <center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/1011-9.jpg\"></center> . If you use these equations to solve a regression problem, it doesn&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t matter which SD you use here, sample or population. However, you should use the same type of SD for  and .","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Inputs include multiple cases (no more than 100) and would end with EOF.<br>Each case starts with a line including two integers p and n. p indicates the kind of problem to solve, 1 means z-score, 2 means one-sample t-test, 3 means Pearson correlation, 4 means regression. n is the number of data points. n is no smaller than 2 and no larger than 10000.<br>If p is 1, then the following input of the case would be n numbers.<br>If p is 2, then the following input of the case would be (n + 1) numbers, the first one is the mean of the population and the rest are the data of the sample.<br>If p is 3 or 4, then the following input of the case would be 2 lines, each with n numbers.
