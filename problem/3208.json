They like to find and solve some interesting number theory problems together. One day, they become interested in some special numbers, which can be expressed as powers of smaller numbers.<br><br>For example, 9=3^2, 64=2^6, 1000=10^3 &#x2026;<br><br>For a given positive integer y, if we can find a largest integer k and a smallest positive integer x, such that x^k=y, then the power of y is regarded as k.<br>It is very easy to find the power of an integer. For example:<br><br>The power of 9 is 2.<br>The power of 64 is 6.<br>The power of 1000 is 3.<br>The power of 99 is 1.<br>The power of 1 does not exist.<br><br>But YY wants to calculate the sum of the power of the integers from a to b. It seems not easy.
