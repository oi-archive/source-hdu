The day begins with all the category 1 classes being taught simultaneously. These all end at the same time, and then all the category 2 classes are taught, etc. Fred has to take exactly one class in each category. His goal is to choose the set of classes that will minimize the amount of  &quot;energy&apos;&apos; required to carry out his daily schedule. <br>The energy requirement of a schedule is the sum of the energy requirement of the classes themselves, and energy consumed by moving from one class to the next through the schedule. <br><br>More specifically, taking the jth class in the ith category uses E<sub>ij</sub> units of energy. The rooms where classes take place are located at integer positions (ranging from 0 to L) along a single hallway. The jth class in the ith category is located at position P<sub>ij</sub>. Fred starts the day at position 0, moves from class to class, according to his chosen schedule, and finally exits at location L. Moving a distance d uses d units of energy. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input is Z &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 20 the number of test cases.
