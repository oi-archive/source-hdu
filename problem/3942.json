At that time, the kinds of gamble were not that much diversified. The gamble can only be performed in a way that two people played against each other and the one who lost the game would have to give the winner $1. Furthermore, the one who lose all his money and lose for another time would get out and never come back. But he still has to pay $1 (He may sell his pants). After playing for quite a long time, they felt as if they had their wings broken, for everyone still here won nothing. <br>As one of the gamblers, mzry1992 wondered what really happened. Now mzry1992 wants you to tell him what happened between some pairs, for example how much does gambler A win from gambler B directly. But actually you do not know the real situation. So you could just tell him one of the possible situations.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are T cases and the first line of the input contains the  number T. The first line of each case consists of one integer N(2 &#x2264;N&#x2264;500), indicating the number of gamblers. Then comes N  lines. The i-th line is a non-negative integer smaller than 101  indicating the i-th gambler&apos;s initial possess. The next line  contains one integer M(0&#x2264;M&#x2264;10000), indicating the number of  pairs of gamblers who gambled. The following M line contains  three integer A, B, t(1&#x2264;A, B&#x2264;N, 1&#x2264;t&#x2264;100), which means that the  gamble A and the gamble B played the game for t times. The  final part of each test case begins with an integer Q  (1&#x2264;Q&#x2264;200000). Then Q lines follows. Each line contains two  integers A, B.
