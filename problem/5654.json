Each watermelon candy has it&apos;s sweetness which denoted by an integer number.<br><br>xiaoxin is very smart since he was a child. He arrange these candies in a line and at each time before eating candies, he selects three continuous watermelon candies from a specific range [L, R] to eat and the chosen triplet must satisfies:<br><br>if he chooses a triplet $(a_i, a_j, a_k)$ then:<br>1.     $j = i + 1, k = j + 1$<br>2.&#xA0;&#xA0;$a_i \\leq a_j \\leq a_k$<br><br>Your task is to calculate how many different ways xiaoxin can choose a triplet in range [L, R]?<br>two triplets $(a_0, a_1, a_2)$ and $(b_0, b_1, b_2)$ are thought as different if and only if:<br>$a_0 \\neq b_0$ or $a_1 \\neq b_1$ or $a_2 \\neq b_2$<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"This problem has multi test cases.
