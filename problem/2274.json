Linle is very nice, he told little WisKey the mysteries of magic. Now, little WisKey began to perform the magic to you.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x201C;Hello, Everybody. I have five decimal numbers named a, b, c, d, e, (0 &lt;= a, b, c, d, e &lt;= 9) and I rearranged them, and then combined them into a number, for example &lt;a, b, c, d, e&gt; = a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e*1. You know the number of permutations is 5! = 120. So you have 120 numbers in your hands, you can pick a number N from the 120 numbers and calculate the sum S of remain 119 numbers. AHA~, If you tell me the S, I can guess the N~!&#x201D;<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;It&#x2019;s easy? Okay, you can challenge this.<br><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Each line will contain an integer S.
