She often wants to know whether the quality of the goods they sell can be equal to the sum quality of several poise weights. Suppose there are N kinds of poise weights, but there are M pairs of them can&#x2019;t be used at the same time, and we know the quality of the goods is V. The question is: can little Min exactly take K form N poise weights, and their sum quality is equal to the goods&#x2019; quality?<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C319-1005-1.jpg\"></center><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases (T &lt; 25).
