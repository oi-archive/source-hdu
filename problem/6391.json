Each switch is associated to a distinct integer in 0.. ${2^N}-1$  with exactly three ones in its binary representation. By setting switches associated with number $X_0, X_1, . . . , X_{m-1}$ to on, any integer Y passing through the machine will render a result of $Y&#x2295;X_0&#x2295;X_1&#x2295; . . .  &#x2295;X_{m-1}$ (here &#x201C;&#x2295;&#x201D; stands for bitwise-XOR). We are interested in the number of configurations capable of transforming integer S into T with exactly K switches set to on. Could you write a program to help us?<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases in the input file. Each test case starts with two integers, N and K (1 &#x2264; N &#x2264; 40, 0 &#x2264; K &#x2264; min{20, $\\binom{n}{3}$}) followed by two binary integers, S and T, each containing exactly N bits. Two successive test cases are separated by a blank line. A case with N = 0 and K = 0 indicates the end of the input file, and should not be processed by your program.
