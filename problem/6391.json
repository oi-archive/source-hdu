Each switch is associated to a distinct integer in 0.. ${2^N}-1$  with exactly three ones in its binary representation. By setting switches associated with number $X_0, X_1, . . . , X_{m-1}$ to on, any integer Y passing through the machine will render a result of $Y&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;X_0&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;X_1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; . . .  &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;X_{m-1}$ (here &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; stands for bitwise-XOR). We are interested in the number of configurations capable of transforming integer S into T with exactly K switches set to on. Could you write a program to help us?<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases in the input file. Each test case starts with two integers, N and K (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 40, 0 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; K &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; min{20, $\\binom{n}{3}$}) followed by two binary integers, S and T, each containing exactly N bits. Two successive test cases are separated by a blank line. A case with N = 0 and K = 0 indicates the end of the input file, and should not be processed by your program.
