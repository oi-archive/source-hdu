In the game, it has N horizontal roads, the ladders always stay at right side vertically, and the ladders are extending towards up and down with unlimited length. If ladder near or cross a road, little WisKey will walk on the road by climbed the ladder. Two roads were covered by each other in the X-axis; it will be considered can be passing through. Each road has an integer W means the dangerous level.<br> <br>Little WisKey must start at No.1 road, and he can&#x2019;t go back, he always go ahead. WisKey want to go some roads, so he needs to know how minimum sum of dangerous will happen. You can finish the game, yes?<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first integer C represents the number of cases, And C cases followed.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>Each test case contains a single integer N roads (1&lt;=N&lt;= 2000) and M destinations (1&lt;=M&lt;=500).
