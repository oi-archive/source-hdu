For example, set{$1,2,3$} can be six different sequence {$1,2,3$},{$1,3,2$},{$2,1,3$},{$2,3,1$},{$3,1,2$},{$3,2,1$}.<br><br><br>Mr. Hdu defines the beautiful value like this:<br>For k from 1 to n, choose k numbers of the set, and calculate the gcd of the k numbers. The beautiful value of the k numbers is k * (gcd of the k chosen numbers). The beautiful value of the set is the sum of all of the beautiful value of  k numbers.<br>Which beautiful value is larger, Mr. Zstu and Mr. Hdu invite the judge Mr. Xiasha to help.<br>Given that both of the value are too big, the stupid Mr. Xiasha mod both of the values by 258280327, so here is the question, which value is bigger after mod operation?<br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.<br>Each test case begins with an integer n$(1 \\leq n \\leq 100000)$<br>The next line is n integers $A_{1},A_{2},...,A_{n}$<br>All of the integers are between 1 and 100000.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, if the beautiful value is equal between Mr. Zstu and Mr. Hdu, output &#x201C;Equal&#x201D;, followed the beautiful value , otherwise output the person&#x2019;s name with bigger beautiful value and followed the beautiful value.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n2 3\n1\n233</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Mr. Zstu 12\nEqual 233</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"ZSTU","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2015+Multi-University+Training+Contest+3&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2015 Multi-University Training Contest 3 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
