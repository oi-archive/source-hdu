This problem is so hard that he had been thinking about the solutions for a couple of days. And then he had a surprise that he misunderstood that problem and easily figured out a solution using segment tree. Now he still wonders that solution for the misread problem.<br>There is a sequence with $N$ positive integers $A1$,$A2$,...,$An$ and $M$ queries. Each query will give you an interval [L,R] and require an answer with YES/NO indicates that whether the numbers in this interval are continuous in its integer range. <br>Let us assume that the maximal number in an interval is $mx$ and the minimal   number is $mi$. The numbers in this interval are continuous in its integer range means that each number from $mi$ to $mx$ appears at least once in this interval.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input starts with one line contains exactly one positive integer $T$ which is the number of test cases.
