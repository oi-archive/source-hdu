The length of its body is exactly 27, thus there is exactly one section of its body in each cell of the cube. The caterpillar&apos;s body is not necessarily straight; it may turn in any of the six directions (provided that the cell adjacent in that direction exists). You&apos;re given the information of which parts of the caterpillar&apos;s body turned in the respective cells, please find whether such a solution exists; if it does, output the lexicographically smallest one. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains one integer, T, the number of test cases.
