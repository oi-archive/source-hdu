(Notice that it&#x2019;s not a loop of them!) In the kingdom, another kind of necklace is very popular, but it is much less precious. If this kind of necklace is a sub-string (not sub-sequence) of the princess&#x2019;, maybe somebody will use the fake one to replace a part of it, and this is quite dangerous. Thus, Henryy want to remove some of the diamonds off from the necklace to make it safer. This number, of course, should be as small as possible.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer T (1 &#x2264; T &#x2264; 10) which means T test cases follow:<br>In each test case:<br>The first line is a string indicating the princess&#x2019; necklace with its length no more than 10000 and made up by characters from &#x2018;a&#x2019; to &#x2018;z&#x2019;.<br>The second line is the common necklace, with its length no more than 1000 and also made up by characters from &#x2018;a&#x2019; to &#x2018;z&#x2019;.<br>The two necklaces cannot be reversed.
