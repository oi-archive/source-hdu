And now, I also prepare a geometry problem for this final exam. According to the experience of many ACMers, geometry problems are always much trouble, but this problem is very easy, after all we are now attending an exam, not a contest :)<br>Give you N (1&lt;=N&lt;=100) segments&#xFF08;&#x7EBF;&#x6BB5;&#xFF09;, please output the number of all intersections&#xFF08;&#x4EA4;&#x70B9;&#xFF09;. You should count repeatedly if M (M&gt;2) segments intersect at the same point.<br><br>Note:<br>You can assume that two segments would not intersect at more than one point. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input contains multiple test cases.
