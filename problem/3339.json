Fortunately, our mysterious spy-net has gotten his plan. Now, we need to stop it.<br>    But the arduous task is obviously not easy. First of all, we know that the operating system of the nuclear weapon consists of some connected electric stations, which forms a huge and complex electric network. Every electric station has its power value. To start the nuclear weapon, it must cost half of the electric network&apos;s power. So first of all, we need to make more than half of the power diasbled. Our tanks are ready for our action in the base(ID is 0), and we must drive them on the road. As for a electric station, we control them if and only if our tanks stop there. 1 unit distance costs 1 unit oil. And we have enough tanks to use.<br>    Now our commander wants to know the minimal oil cost in this action.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"    The first line of the input contains a single integer T, specifying the number of testcase in the file.<br>    For each case, first line is the integer n(1&lt;= n&lt;= 100), m(1&lt;= m&lt;= 10000), specifying the number of the stations(the IDs are 1,2,3...n), and the number of the roads between the station(bi-direction).<br>    Then m lines follow, each line is interger st(0&lt;= st&lt;= n), ed(0&lt;= ed&lt;= n), dis(0&lt;= dis&lt;= 100), specifying the start point, end point, and the distance between.<br>    Then n lines follow, each line is a interger pow(1&lt;= pow&lt;= 100), specifying the electric station&apos;s power by ID order.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"    The minimal oil cost in this action.<br>    If not exist print &quot;impossible&quot;(without quotes).","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n2 3\n0 2 9\n2 1 3\n1 0 2\n1\n3\n2 1\n2 1 3\n1\n3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5\nimpossible</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"Lost@HDU","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=HDOJ+Monthly+Contest+%A8C+2010.03.06&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> HDOJ Monthly Contest &#x2013; 2010.03.06 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
