The path&apos;s length is N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100), and there are many insects along the way. Suppose the <br>original coordinate of Fog is 0. Fog can stay still or jump forward T units, A &lt;= T &lt;= B. Fog will eat up all the insects wherever he stays, but he will <br>get tired after K jumps and can not jump any more. The number of insects (always less than 10000) in each position of the path is given. <br>How many insects can Fog eat at most? <br>Note that Fog can only jump within the range [0, N), and whenever he jumps, his coordinate increases. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases. <br>The first line contains an integer T indicating the number of test cases. <br>For each test case: <br>The first line contains four integers N, A, B(1 &lt;= A &lt;= B &lt;= N), K (K &gt;= 1). <br>The next line contains N integers, describing the number of insects in each position of the path.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"each test case: <br>Output one line containing an integer - the maximal number of insects that Fog can eat. <br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n4 1 2 2 \n1 2 3 4 </div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">8</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=ECJTU+2008+Summer+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> ECJTU 2008 Summer Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
