Because in some cases, the track of point may be beautiful curve. For example, in polar Coordinate system,  $\\rho = \\cos 3\\theta$ is like rose, $\\rho = 1 - \\sin \\theta$ is a Cardioid, and so on. Today, there is a simple problem about it which you need to solve.<br><br>Give you a triangle $\\Delta ABC$ and AB = AC. M is the midpoint of BC. Point P is in $\\Delta ABC$ and makes $min\\{\\angle MPB + \\angle APC, \\angle MPC + \\angle APB\\}$ maximum. The track of P is $\\Gamma$. Would you mind calculating the length of $\\Gamma$?<br><br>Given the coordinate of A, B, C, please output the length of  $\\Gamma$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are T ($1 \\leq T \\leq 10^4$) test cases. For each case, one line includes six integers the coordinate of A, B, C in order. It is guaranteed that AB = AC and three points are not collinear. All coordinates do not exceed $10^4$ by absolute value.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each case, first please output &quot;Case #k: &quot;, k is the number of test case. See sample output for more detail. Then, please output the length of $\\Gamma$ with exactly 4 digits after the decimal point.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n0 1 -1 0 1 0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 3.2214</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2015+ACM%2FICPC+Asia+Regional+Shanghai+Online&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2015 ACM/ICPC Asia Regional Shanghai Online </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
