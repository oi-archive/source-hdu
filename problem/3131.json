The king, however, is &quot;three blind&quot; and cannot visualize any number containing the digit &apos;3&apos; in its base 10 representation. He does intuitively sense the number between 2 and 4 and compensates for his blindness in the following manner: whenever he wants to state any number containing the digit &apos;3&apos;, he will speak a series of numbers until they can all be combined (in the order given) via addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to produce the desired value which contains the digit &apos;3&apos;. Mathematical operators work from left to right without any other regard for order of precedence (i.e. 6 + 7 * 11 = 143 --&gt; a number with a &apos;3&apos;).<br><br>For example, if the king says &quot;1 2 5&quot;, then a knight will say &apos;3&apos; using the following logic:<br><br>1 2 5 = 1 * 2 &#x2013; 5 = 2 &#x2013; 5 = |2 &#x2013; 5| = 3<br><br>Note that there are no negative numbers in optimistic Camelot. Every subtraction will produce a nonnegative result by what is called, in these enlightened times, the absolute value. All division is integer division, i.e. 7/5 = 1. Obviously, if the number zero appears as a divisor, then division will not be attempted.<br><br>The court, however, has a problem. Some of the computations produce more than 1 number containing the digit &apos;3&apos;! You have been appointed to write a program which computes and displays the most frequently appearing number containing the digit &apos;3&apos;. In the event of a tie, use the largest number.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input will consist of an unspecified number of lines.
