He likes to draw many interesting graphics on the paper.<br>One day,Jack found a new interesting graph called Palindrome graph. No matter how many times to flip or rotate 90 degrees, the palindrome graph are always unchanged.<br>Jack took a paper with n*n grid and K kinds of pigments.Some of the grid has been filled with color and can not be modified.Jack want to know:how many ways can he paint a palindrome graph?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases.<br>For each test case,there are three integer n m k(0&lt;n&lt;=10000,0&lt;=m&lt;=2000,0&lt;k&lt;=1000000), indicate n*n grid and k kinds of pigments.<br>Then follow m lines,for each line,there are 2 integer i,j.indicated that grid(i,j) (0&lt;=i,j&lt;n) has been filled with color.<br>You can suppose that jack have at least one way to paint a palindrome graph.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each case,print a integer in a line,indicate the number of ways jack can paint.
