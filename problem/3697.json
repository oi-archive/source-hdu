Students select their course on the web course system. There are n courses, the ith course is available during the time interval (A<sub>i</sub>,B<sub>i</sub>). That means, if you want to select the ith course, you must select it after time Ai and before time Bi. Ai and Bi are all in minutes. A student can only try to select a course every 5 minutes, but he can start trying at any time, and try as many times as he wants. For example, if you start trying to select courses at 5 minutes 21 seconds, then you can make other tries at 10 minutes 21 seconds, 15 minutes 21 seconds,20 minutes 21 seconds&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; and so on. A student can&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t select more than one course at the same time.
