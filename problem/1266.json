Here, reverse number is defined as follows:<br>1. The reverse number of a positive integer ending without 0 is general reverse, for example, reverse (12) = 21;<br>2. The reverse number of a negative integer is negative, for example, reverse (-12) = -21;<br>3. The reverse number of an integer ending with 0 is described as example, reverse (1200) = 2100.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Input file contains multiple test cases.
