The way he marks the rope is:<br><strong>1. </strong> He will choose a color that hasn&#x2019;t been used<br><strong>2. </strong> He will choose a length L (N&gt;L&gt;1) and he defines the mark&#x2019;s value equals L<br><strong>3. </strong> From the head of the rope, after every L length, he marks on the rope (you can assume the mark&#x2019;s length is 0 )<br><strong>4. </strong> When he chooses the length L in step 2, he has made sure that if he marks with this length, the last mark will be at the tail of the rope<br>Eric is a curious boy, he want to choose K kinds of marks. Every two of the marks&#x2019; value are coprime(gcd(l1,l2)=1). Now Eric wants to know the max K. After he chooses the max K kinds of marks, he wants to know the max sum of these K kinds of marks&#x2019; values.<br>You can assume that Eric always can find at least one kind of length to mark on the rope.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"First line: a positive number T (T&lt;=500) representing the number of test cases<br>2 to T+1 lines: every line has only a positive number N (N&lt;2<sup>63</sup>) representing the length of rope","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For every test case, you only need to output K and S separated with a space","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n180\n198</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3 18\n3 22</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"HIT","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2012+Multi-University+Training+Contest+5&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2012 Multi-University Training Contest 5 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
