Gameia !&apos;. The game goes like this :<br> 0. There is a tree with all node unpainted initial.<br> 1. Because Bob is the VIP player, so Bob has K chances to make a small change on the tree any time during the game if he wants, whether before or after Alice&apos;s action. These chances can be used together or separate, changes will happen in a flash. each change is defined as cut an edge on the tree. <br> 2. Then the game starts, Alice and Bob take turns to paint an unpainted node, Alice go first, and then Bob.<br> 3. In Alice&apos;s move, she can paint an unpainted node into white color.<br> 4. In Bob&apos;s move, he can paint an unpainted node into black color, and what&apos;s more, all the other nodes which connects with the node directly will be painted or repainted into black color too, even if they are white color before.<br> 5. When anybody can&apos;t make a move, the game stop, with all nodes painted of course. If they can find a node with white color, Alice win the game, otherwise Bob.<br>Given the tree initial, who will win the game if both players play optimally?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input gives the number of test cases T; T test cases follow.<br>Each case begins with one line with two integers N and K : the size of the tree and the max small changes that Bob can make.<br>The next line gives the information of the tree, nodes are marked from 1 to N, node 1 is the root, so the line contains N-1 numbers, the i-th of them give the farther node of the node i+1.<br><br>Limits<br>$T \\leq 100$<br>$1 \\leq N \\leq 500$<br>$0 \\leq K \\leq 500$<br>$1 \\leq Pi \\leq i$","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case output one line denotes the answer.<br>If Alice can win, output &quot;Alice&quot; , otherwise &quot;Bob&quot;.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n2 1\n1\n3 1\n1 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Bob\nAlice</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2017+Multi-University+Training+Contest+-+Team+6&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2017 Multi-University Training Contest - Team 6 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
