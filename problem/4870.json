Recently, she has found a new kind of programming competition named &quot;TopTopTopCoder&quot;. Every user who has registered in &quot;TopTopTopCoder&quot; system will have a rating, and the initial value of rating equals to zero. After the user participates in the contest held by &quot;TopTopTopCoder&quot;, her/his rating will be updated depending on her/his rank. Supposing that her/his current rating is X, if her/his rank is between on 1-200 after contest, her/his rating will be min(X+50,1000). Her/His rating will be max(X-100,0) otherwise. To reach 1000 points as soon as possible, this little girl registered two accounts. She uses the account with less rating in each contest. The possibility of her rank between on 1 - 200 is P for every contest. Can you tell her how many contests she needs to participate in to make one of her account ratings reach 1000 points?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   There are several test cases.
