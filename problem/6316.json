For every weight i in [1,10], there are $a_i$ kinds of goods weighted i.<br>The shops are odd because one is only allowed to buy one item or nothing in each shop. And though goods in every shop are different, the array $a$ for each shop is the same.<br>As you love odd things so much, you wonder for how many total weights, there are odd ways to buy items in n odd shops to achieve this total weight.
