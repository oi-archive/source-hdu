Thus, 12 * 483 = 5,796. I now also propose to include the cases where there are one, four and four digits, such as 4 * 1,738 = 6,952. Can you find all possible solutions in both cases?&#x201D;- Amusement in Mathematics, by Ernest Dudeney.<br><br>Now we want to arrange some of the nine digits (without &#x2018;0&#x2019;) in three groups of a, b and c digits, so that the first two numbers when multiplied together make the third. In addition, no digit can be used more than once in a single multiplication. You have to find how many solution exist there for given a, b and c.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
