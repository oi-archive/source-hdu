One day, Mr. Panda came up with a puzzle while he was playing the following game with Mrs. Panda:<br>In a plane, there are M points $(0,0),(1,0), ..,(M-2,0),(M-1,0)$ in a segment. You are also given $N$ circles, the radius of $i^{th}$ circle is $R_i$. In the game, you are allowed to put center of any circle into one of the $M$ points without making circles overlap (that is, if the intersection of their circles has a positive area).<br>An arrangement of circles is considered as valid if every circle&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s center is in one of the $M$ points. Mr. Panda wanted to know length of empty units which are not covered by any circle in the segment from $(0,0)$ to $(M-1,0)$.<br>Because there are too many arrangements, Mr. Panda only wanted to know $\\sum L_i^2$  modulo $1,000,000,007$ where $L_i$ is length of empty units in the $i^{th}$ arrangement.<br>The puzzle has confused Mr. Panda for a long time. Luckily, Mr. Panda knows you are in this contest. Could you help Mr. Panda&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s solve the puzzle?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ test cases follow.<br>Each test case starts with a line consisting of two integers $N$, the number of circles, and $M$, the number<br>of points.<br>Then, a line consisting of $N$ integer numbers follows, the $i^{th}$ number $R_i$ indicates radius of the $i^{th}$ circle.<br>$1 \\leq T \\leq 50$<br>$1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$<br>$2 \\leq M \\leq 10^{18}$<br>$1 \\leq R_i \\leq 10^5$","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one line containing &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Case #x: y&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, where $x$ is the test case number (starting from 1) and $y$ is the number that Mr. Panda wants to know for the $i^{th}$ input data set.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5\n3 6\n1 1 1\n2 5\n1 2\n2 6\n1 2\n3 2\n1 1 1\n1 10\n50</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 12\nCase #2: 2\nCase #3: 14\nCase #4: 0\nCase #5: 0\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\n<center><img src=\"../../../data/images/C787-1004-1.jpg\"></center>\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2017%D6%D0%B9%FA%B4%F3%D1%A7%C9%FA%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%BE%BA%C8%FC-%D7%DC%BE%F6%C8%FC-%D6%D8%CF%D6%C8%FC%A3%A8%B8%D0%D0%BB%B9%FE%B9%A4%B4%F3%A3%A9&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2017&#xFFFD;&#x439;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x467;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x1BE;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;-&#xFFFD;&#x73E;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;-&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x43B;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
