Two balls are put in different positions inside the rectangle. The balls are so tiny that their volume can be ignored. Initially, two balls will move with velocity (1, 1). When a ball collides with any side of the rectangle, it will rebound without loss of energy. The rebound follows the law of refiection (i.e.  the angle at which the ball is incident on the wall equals the angle at which it is reflected).<br><br>   After they choose the initial position, Matt wants you to tell him where will the two balls collide for the first time.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The first line contains only one integer T which indicates the number of test cases.<br><br>   For each test case, the first line contains two integers x and y.
