However, learning magical knowledge alone is insufficient to become a great magician. Sometimes, Harry also has to gain knowledge from other certain subjects, such as language, mathematics, English, and even algorithm. <br>Today, Harry is on his biological class, his teacher is doing experiment with DNA right now. But the clever teacher faces a difficult problem. He has lots of genes. Every time he picks gene a and gene b. If he want to connect gene a and gene b, he should calculate the length of longest part that the gene a&#x2019;s suffix and gene b&#x2019;s prefix can overlap together. For example gene a is &quot;AAT&quot; and gene b is &quot;ATT&quot;, then the longest common part is &quot;AT&quot;, so the answer is 2. And can you solve this difficult problem for him?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"They are sever test cases, you should process to the end of file.<br>For each test case, there are two integers n and m ($1 \\leq n \\leq 100000, 1 \\leq m \\leq 100000$)on the first line, indicate the number of genes and the number of queries.<br>The next following n line, each line contains a non-empty string composed by characters &apos;A&apos; , &apos;T&apos; , &apos;C&apos; , &apos;G&apos;.
