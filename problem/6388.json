One day when he was learning stack, he suddenly thought that it would be more interesting to add timestamp to each stack command, and wanted to delete the element(even it&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s not the top one) as he wanted.<br><br>So he invented a stack called &quot;YJJ&apos;s stack&quot;, which supports the following four command:<br><br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; push v t &#xFFFD;C push  $v$  into YJJ&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s stack, whose timestamp is  $t$ ; <br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; delete v t &#xFFFD;C delete the uppermost element from the stack which is equal to  $v$ , whose timestamp is  $t$ ; <br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; pop t  &#xFFFD;C pop the top element from YJJ&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s stack, whose timestamp is  $t$ ; <br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; query t  &#xFFFD;C execute a query operation which is described below, whose timestamp is  $t$ ;<br><br>There is an empty set of commands initially. When an command except  query t  arrives, we put the command into the set. When an command  query t  arrives, we process as follows:<br><br>1.  Clear YJJ&apos;s stack .<br>2.  Execute the command currently in the set whose timestamp is less than  t .<br>3.  The executing order of command is ordered by their timestamp in ascending order.<br>4. Print the top element in the stack.<br><br>Records of command are in arriving order, you are required to execute according to above rules. Another three constraints are made to simplify the problem :<br><br>1.  All the  pop  and  delete  command are valid. In another word, if you do the process correctly,  pop   command will not be excuted on an empty YJJ&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s stack and  delete   v   command will not be excuted on an  YJJ&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s stack without  v .<br>2.  All timestamps are different.<br>3.  The number of  pop  command is no more than $5$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T$ $(1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;T&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;10)$,which is the number of test cases.<br><br>In each case, the first line of the input contains an integer $N$ $(1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;N&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;1.2\\times 10^5)$. The following $N$ lines each contain an command in one of the following four formats:  push v t ,  delete v t ,  pop t ,  query t , where $1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;v&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;5, 0&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;10^9$, and  $v, t$  are integers.
