Of course, one of their key considerations is choosing a good name for the company. Palindromes are cool.

Unfortunately, they cannot think of a nifty company name that is also a palindrome. <br>Maybe at least the telephone number of their company could be a palindrome. However, they really want their customers to be able to call them, so they want to choose the company name so that, when it is typed using the letters printed on a phone keypad, the result is also their phone number. (On a standard phone keypad, the following keys contain the corresponding letters: 2: ABC, 3: DEF, 4: GHI, 5: JKL, 6: MNO, 7: PQRS, 8: TUV, 9: WXYZ.) <br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C386-1004-1.JPG\"></center><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a single integer, the number of lines to follow.
