It is guaranteed that it does not go to minus when the competition ends. For example someone solves the $ith$ problem after $x$ minutes of the competition beginning.

He/She will begin to solve the next problem on $x+1$ minute.<br><br>dxy who attend this competition with excellent strength, can measure the time of solving each problem exactly.He will spend $C_i(C_i \\leq t)$ minutes to solve the ith problem. It is because he is so godlike that he can solve every problem of this competition. But to the limitation of time, it&apos;s probable he cannot solve every problem in this competition.
