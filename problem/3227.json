The king, standing at the Origin (0, 0, 0), is observing the heroes. No range of activity will contain the king&#x2019;s position.<br><br>You may assume that no hero could meet others, that means these &#x201C;range&#x201D; have no common point. Your task is to find number K, indicating that the king can choose at most K heroes such that no pairs of chosen heroes cause one may block the king&#x2019;s view line to observe another. In other words, no hero can appear on the segment between another hero and the King.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases, the number of them, T, is given in the very first line of the input, followed by T cases.<br><br>For each test case:<br>First line contains an integer N, the number of heroes, 1&#x2264;N&#x2264;40.
