In the first quadrant, the curve $f$ is a monotone increasing function that $f(x)=\\sqrt{x}$. The curve $g$ is decreasing and $g(x)=K/x$.<br>To calculate the $x$-coordinate of the only intersection in the first quadrant is the following question. For accuracy, we need the nearest rational number to $x$ and its denominator should not be larger than $100000$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is an integer $T~(1\\le T \\le 100000)$ which is the number of test cases.<br>For each test case, there is a line containing the integer $K~(1\\le K\\le 100000)$, which is the only coefficient.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output the nearest rational number to $x$.
