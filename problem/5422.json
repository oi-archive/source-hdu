Yuta is worrying about this situation, so he gives Rikka some math tasks to practice. There is one of them:<br><br>Yuta has a non-direct graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The length of each edge is 1. Now he wants to add exactly an edge which connects two different vertices and minimize the length of the shortest path between vertice 1 and vertice $n$. Now he wants to know the minimal length of the shortest path and the number of the ways of adding this edge.<br><br>It is too difficult for Rikka. Can you help her?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are no more than 100 testcases. <br><br>For each testcase, the first line contains two numbers $n,m(2 \\leq n \\leq 100, 0 \\leq m \\leq 100)$.<br><br>Then $m$ lines follow.
