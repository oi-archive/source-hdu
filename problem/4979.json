One day, the lottery company brings out a new form of lottery called accumulated lottery. In a normal lottery, you pick 7 numbers from N numbers. You will get reward according to how many numbers you match. If you match all 7 numbers, you will get the top prize for 1 billion dollars!!! Unlike normal lottery, an M-accumulated lottery allows you to pick M numbers from N numbers. If M is big enough, this may significantly increase your possibility to win. (Of course it cost more&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;) <br><br>   Some people buy multiple accumulated lotteries to guarantee a higher possibility to get the top prize. Despite of this, it&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s still not worthy to guarantee a top prize.Knowing this, Dragon changes his target to second tier prize. <b>To get a second tier prize, you need to contain all of the R numbers with M numbers picked.</b>Given N, M and R, Dragon wants to know how many M-accumulated lotteries he needs to buy, so that he can guarantee that he can get at least the second tier prize.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The first line of input contains only one integer T, the number of test cases.<br> <br>   For each case, there&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s a single line contains N, M and R(1&lt;=R&lt;=M&lt;=N&lt;=8).","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"   Each output should occupy one line.
