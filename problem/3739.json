One day, GXX asked Lost to work out the Longest Increasing Subsequence(for short, LIS) of a given sequence {A_1, A_2, ..., A_N}. Knowing this problem well, Lost simply copied a program from his article and solved the problem in seconds. So that GXX became frustrated. She wanted to cheat Lost by removing some elements from the original sequence to make Lost&apos;s answer go wrong. For convinience, she would like to remove least number of elements.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The beginning of the input is an integer T(T &lt;= 10), which is the number of test cases.
