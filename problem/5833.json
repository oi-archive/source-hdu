One day, Zhu wants to test the ability of 772002, so he asks 772002 to solve a math problem. <br><br>But 772002 has a appointment with his girl friend. So 772002 gives this problem to you.<br><br>There are $n$ numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$. The value of the prime factors of each number does not exceed $2000$, you can choose at least one number and multiply them, then you can get a number $b$.<br><br> How many different ways of choices can make $b$ is a perfect square number. The answer maybe too large, so you should output the answer modulo by $1000000007$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"First line is a positive integer $T$ , represents there are $T$ test cases.<br><br>For each test case:<br><br>First line includes a number $n(1 \\leq n \\leq 300)$&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;next line there are $n$ numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, (1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^{18})$.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For the i-th test case , first output Case #i: in a single line.<br><br>Then output the answer of i-th test case modulo by $1000000007$.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n3\n3 3 4\n3\n2 2 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1:\n3\nCase #2:\n3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"UESTC","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2016%D6%D0%B9%FA%B4%F3%D1%A7%C9%FA%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%BE%BA%C8%FC+-+%CD%F8%C2%E7%D1%A1%B0%CE%C8%FC&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2016&#xFFFD;&#x439;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x467;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x1BE;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; - &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x461;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
