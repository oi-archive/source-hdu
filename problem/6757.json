You, as a guardian of the town, should protect the town from the attack of those monsters. As you are a smart warrior, you are going to eliminate K of them so that all the remaining monsters are scared and let them quit the town themselves.<br><br>In order to defeat a monster, you should consume A unit of energy while you restore B unit of energy after defeating it. If your energy before attack is less than A, you will be exterminated and the town will be ruined. These values A and B depends on the monster, so they may be distinct for different monsters. You may arbitrarily choose monsters to be killed. Note that you can defeat monsters in any order. You want to know the minimum amount of initial energy needed to kill at least K monsters. You are required to calculate the answer for all K=1$ \\cdots $N.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains a single integer T (1&#x2264;T&#x2264;600), denoting the number of test cases.
