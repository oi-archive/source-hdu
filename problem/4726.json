But Kia is so careless and alway forget to carry a number when the sum of two digits exceeds 9. For example, when she calculates 4567+5789, she will get 9246, and for 1234+9876, she will get 0. Ghee is angry about this, and makes a hard problem for her to solve:<br>Now Kia has two integers A and B, she can shuffle the digits in each number as she like, but leading zeros are not allowed. That is to say, for A = 11024, she can rearrange the number as 10124, or 41102, or many other, but 02411 is not allowed.<br>After she shuffles A and B, she will add them together, in her own way. And what will be the maximum possible sum of A &quot;+&quot; B ?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The \frst line has a number T (T &lt;= 25) , indicating the number of test cases.<br>For each test case there are two lines.
