Homework always matters a lot. To get high grades, he has no choice but to ask you for help. <br>Here is the problem: Can you calculate the numbers of ways to put 2$n$ different balls into  exact same boxes and each box contains exactly 2 balls.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input starts with one line contains exactly one positive integer $T$ which is the number of test cases.<br>Each test case contains one line with exactly one positive integer $n$ which has been explained above.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one line containing &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;y&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; where y is the number of different ways modulo 2^64.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n1\n2\n100</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n3\n7119879074588212521\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\n1&lt;=T&lt;=10,1&lt;=N&lt;=10^18\nFor test case 1, it is obviously that there is only one way to do so.\nFor test case 2, we could assume that 4 different are indexed from 1 to 4.
