Now we define MAVS, the abbreviate of Maximum Absolute Value Subsequence, to be any (if more than one) subsequences of L whose absolute value is maximum among all subsequences. Given the length of L, your task is to find the expectation of the absolute value of MAVS.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There is only one input file.
