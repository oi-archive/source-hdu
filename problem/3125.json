In the early modern period, in the Fraktur script, which was widespread through Europe in the Middle Ages, one slash(/) represented a comma, while two slashes (//) represented a dash.<br>With the wide use of computers, slash appeared far more than at any previous time in history. On Unix-like systems and in URLs, the slash is to separate directory and file components of a path:<br>/home/whuacm/chaeyeon/Sherlockpp.jpg<br>http://acm.whu.edu.cn/<br>But in Windows systems, it uses (\\) to separate directory and file components of a path:<br>C:\\Users\\v-yungao\\Music\\Shake<br>That really confuses me. Could you help me to judge if the string I wrote is right. <br>Please notice that I would only make a mistake by changing (\\) to (/) or (/) to (\\). All the strings were constituted by a-z, A-Z, 0-9, (.) , (\\) and (/), no other characters would appear in the strings.<br>A string of URL always begins with &#x201C;[a-zA-Z]+://&#x201D; (Notice (/) maybe changed to (\\) ), in which &#x201C;[a-zA-Z]+&#x201D; represents any non-empty string of letters.<br>Windows path begins with &#x201C;[a-zA-Z]:\\&#x201D; (Notice (\\) maybe changed to (/)), in which &#x201C;[a-zA-Z]&#x201D; means an English letter.
