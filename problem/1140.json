The first salvo in this campaign will be a coordinated pre-emptive attack on as many tropical depressions as possible. GW reckons that the attack will neutralize the tropical depressions before they become storms, and dissuade others from forming. <br>GW has at his disposal k space-to-earth killer satellites at various locations in space. m tropical depressions are known to exist at various locations on the earth&apos;s surface. Each satellite can attack any number of targets on the earth provided there is line of sight between the satellite and each target. How many different targets can be hit? <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases. Each case begins with a line containing integers 0 &lt; k, m &amp;le 100 as defined above. k lines follow, each giving x,y,z - the location in space of a satellite at the scheduled time of attack. m lines then follow, each giving x,y,z - the location of a target tropical depression. Assume the earth is a sphere centred at (0,0,0) with circumference 40,000 km. All targets will be on the surface of the earth (within 10-9 km) and all satellites will be at least 50 km above the surface. A line containing 0 0 follows the last test case. <br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output a line giving the total number of targets that can be hit. If a particular target falls within 10-8 km of the boundary between being within line-of-sight and not, it may be counted either way. (That is, you need not consider rounding error so long as it does not exceed 10-8 km.) <br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3 2\n-10.82404031 -1594.10929753 -6239.77925152\n692.58497298 -5291.64700245 4116.92402298\n3006.49210582 2844.61925179 5274.03201053\n2151.03635167 2255.29684503 5551.13972186\n-1000.08700886 -4770.25497971 4095.48127333\n3 4\n0 0 6466.197723676\n0 6466.197723676 0\n6466.197723676 0 0\n6366.197723676 0 0\n6365.197723676 112.833485488 0\n0 0 6366.197723676\n0 -6366.197723676 0\n0 0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=University+of+Waterloo+Local+Contest+2005.09.24&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> University of Waterloo Local Contest 2005.09.24 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
