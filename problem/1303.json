You will need a program to help you with the grading. This program should be able to scan the lists and output the correct answer for each one. For example, given the list <br>1 4 3 2 9 7 18 22<br><br>your program should answer 3, as 2 is twice 1, 4 is twice 2, and 18 is twice 9. <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file will consist of one or more lists of numbers.
