She had to drop packages at specific points scattered in a dangerous area. Furthermore, the pilot could only fly over the area once in a straight line, and she had to fly over as many points as possible. All points were given by means of integer coordinates in a two-dimensional space. The pilot wanted to know the largest number of points from the given set that all lie on one line. Can you write a program that calculates this number? <br><br>Your program has to be efficient! <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of multiple test cases, and each case begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of points, followed by N pairs of integers, where 1 &lt; N &lt; 700.
