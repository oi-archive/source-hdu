Now, the results have been published, so Bill and Ted want to check who was right. But checking the results of their many friends would take a very long time, and they need the evaluation to be done by a computer. Since they are not so good at programming, they ask you for help. ","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The data provided by Bill and Ted has the following format: The first line consists of the number p of parties followed by the number g of guesses (with 1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; p &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 50 and 1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; g &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 10000). Then follow p lines, each line consisting of a unique party name of length &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 20 (only containing letters a-z, A-Z and digits 0-9) and the achieved vote percentage of this party with one digit after the decimal point. After the parties follow g lines, each consisting of a guess. A guess has the form P<sub>1</sub> + P<sub>2</sub> + ... + P<sub>k</sub> COMP n, where P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>k</sub> are party names, COMP is one of the comparison operators &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;= or = and n is an integer between 0 and 100, inclusively. Each party name occurs at most once in each guess. <br><br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each guess, sum up the vote percentages of the parties and compare them with the specified integer n.
