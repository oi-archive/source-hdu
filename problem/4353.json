As a greedy man, he wants to choose the part with a lot of gold mines, but unluckily, he is short with money.<br><br>Those M gold mines can also be seen as points, but they may be different from those N points. You may safely assume that there will be no three points lying on the same line for all N+M points.<br><br>Bob alreadys knows that the price to buy an area is proportional to its size, so he changes his mind. Now he wants to buy a part like this: If the part&apos;s size is A, and contains B gold mines, then A/B will be minimum among all the possible parts he can choose. Now, please tell him that minimum number, if all the parts he can choose has B=0, just output -1.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"First line of the input is a single integer T(T&lt;=30), indicating there are T test cases.<br>For each test case, the first line is two integers N(3&lt;=N&lt;=200) and M(1&lt;=M&lt;=500), the number of vertexs and the number of mines.
