Output $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\min(i-l_i,r_i-i)$.<br>Obviously, this problem is too easy for Tonyfang. So he thought about a harder version:<br>Given two integers n and x, counting the number of permutations of 1 to n which $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\min(i-l_i,r_i-i)=x$ where l and r are defined as above, output the number mod P.<br>Tonyfang solved it quickly, now comes your turn!","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"In the first line, before every test case, an integer P.<br>There are multiple test cases, please read till the end of input file.<br>For every test case, a line contain three integers n and x, separated with space.<br>$1 \\leq n \\leq 200, 1 \\leq x \\leq 10^9$.
