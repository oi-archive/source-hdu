As a first step, he&apos;ll arrange a security agent from any of the corporation at each intersection of two roads in Bytecity.<br><br>The Bytecity has a very special and complex transportation system. There are $n$ straight and long roads in the city, each of them can be treated as an <b>infinitely long line</b> on a two dimensional plane, and no $3$ or more roads have a common intersection.<br><br>In order to prevent agents from slacking during work, the mayor has decided to arrange agents from two different security corporations at any two <b>adjacent intersections</b>. We said that two intersections are <b>adjacent</b> if they are on a same road, and there is no other intersection between these two intersections on that road. Also, the mayor thinks less number of security corporations is more manageable. Can you help the mayor to distribute all the intersections to as less security corporations as possible?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains an integer $T$ indicating the total number of test cases.
