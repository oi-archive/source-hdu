His most recent assignment is to find a maximum matching in a special kind of graph. This graph is undirected, has N vertices and each vertex has degree 3. Furthermore, the graph is 2-edge-connected (that is, at least 2 edges need to be removed in order to make the graph disconnected). A matching is a subset of the graph&#x2019;s edges, such that no two edges in the subset have a common vertex. A maximum matching is a matching having the maximum cardinality.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Given a series of instances of the special graph mentioned above, find the cardinality of a maximum matching for each instance.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains an integer number T, representing the number of graph descriptions to follow. Each description contains on the first line an even integer number N (4&lt;=N&lt;=5000), representing the number of vertices. Each of the next 3*N/2 lines contains two integers A and B, separated by one blank, denoting that there is an edge between vertex A and vertex B. The vertices are numbered from 1 to N.
