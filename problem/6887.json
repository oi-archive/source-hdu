Specifically, for the $i$-th task $p_i$, the scheduler will select $t_{p_i}$ workers randomly from all workers which hasn&apos;t been assigned tasks at this moment. Each of those free workers share a universal equal probability to be selected. Note that disconnected workers may also be selected. In this scenario, the current scheduling will be considered as a failure and retry automatically and immediately. Only when the scheduling of the current task is successful, the next task will be proceeded.<br><br>Now you need to find an optimal  executive order of $p_1 ,p_2 , \\ldots p_n$ to minimize the expected amount of the scheduling process.
