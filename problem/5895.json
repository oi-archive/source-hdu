If we know the birthday of the student is n, the year at the beginning of the semester is y, the course number x and the course total score s, then the forecast mark is $x^{g(n*y)}\\%(s+1)$.<br> QSC sequence published caused a sensation, after a number of students to find out the results of the prediction is very accurate, the shortcoming is the complex calculation. As clever as you are, can you write a program to predict the mark?<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"First line is an integer T(1&#x2264;T&#x2264;1000).<br><br>The next T lines were given n, y, x, s, respectively.<br><br>n&#x3001;x is 8 bits decimal integer, for example, 00001234.<br><br>y is 4 bits decimal integer, for example, 1234.<br>n&#x3001;x&#x3001;y are not negetive.<br><br> 1&#x2264;s&#x2264;100000000","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case the output is only one integer number ans in a line.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n20160830 2016 12345678 666\n20101010 2014 03030303 333</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n317</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2016+ACM%2FICPC+Asia+Regional+Shenyang+Online&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2016 ACM/ICPC Asia Regional Shenyang Online </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
