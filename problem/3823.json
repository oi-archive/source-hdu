We call a nonnegative integer A is the integer B&#x2019;s Prime Friend when the sum of A and B is a prime.<br>So an integer has many prime friends, for example, 1 has infinite prime friends: 1, 2, 4, 6, 10 and so on. This problem is very simple, given two integers A and B, find the minimum common prime friend which will make them not only become primes but also prime neighbor. We say C and D is prime neighbor only when both of them are primes and integer(s) between them is/are not.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer T, indicating the number of test cases.<br>Each test case only contains two integers A and B.<br><br>Technical Specification<br><br>1. 1 &lt;= T &lt;= 1000<br>2. 1 &lt;= A, B &lt;= 150","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output the case number first, then the minimum common prime friend of A and B, if not such number exists, output -1.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n2 4\n3 6</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case 1: 1\nCase 2: -1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Author","content":"iSea@WHU","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=The+6th+Central+China+Invitational+Programming+Contest+and+9th+Wuhan+University+Programming+Contest+Final&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> The 6th Central China Invitational Programming Contest and 9th Wuhan University Programming Contest Final </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
