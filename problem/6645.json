The node at the ``top&apos;&apos; of the heap(with no parents) is called the root node.<br><br>Usually, we may store a heap of size $n$ in an array $h_1,h_2,\\dots,h_n$, where $h_i$ denotes the key of the $i$-th node. The root node is the $1$-th node, and the parent of the $i(2\\leq i\\leq n)$-th node is the $\\lfloor\\frac{i}{2}\\rfloor$-th node.<br><br>Sunset and Elephant is playing a game on a min heap. The two players move in turns, and Sunset moves first. In each move, the current player selects a node which has no children, adds its key to this player&apos;s score and removes the node from the heap.<br><br>The game ends when the heap is empty. Both players want to maximize their scores and will play optimally. Please write a program to figure out the final result of the game.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T(1\\leq T\\leq 10000)$, denoting the number of test cases.<br><br>In each test case, there is one integer $n(1\\leq n\\leq 100000)$ in the first line, denoting the number of nodes.<br><br>In the second line, there are $n$ integers $h_1,h_2,...,h_n(1\\leq h_i\\leq 10^9,h_{\\lfloor\\frac{i}{2}\\rfloor}\\leq h_i)$, denoting the key of each node.<br><br>It is guaranteed that $\\sum n\\leq 10^6$.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print a single line containing two integers $S$ and $E$, denoting the final score of Sunset and Elephant.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n3\n1 2 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2019+Multi-University+Training+Contest+6&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2019 Multi-University Training Contest 6 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
