His IQ is low recently, so he ask you for help.<br>In a room, there are $N$ tables numbered $1,2,3,&#x2026;,N$. There is a blue card on each table. The ith card is on the ith table. On the ith blue card, there is a number $A_{i}$. Now you can put on a red card on each table and the number on the ith red card is $B_{i}(1\\leq B_{i}\\leq A_{i})$. Then a problem comes, for one arrangement how many pair of $(i,j)$ that satisfy $i &lt; j$ and $ gcd(B_{i},B_{j})$ has at most one different prime factor? We call these pairs $good pairs$. For example, 12 has two different prime factors. $(12=2*2*3)$<br>But this is not you problem. You can easily know there are $\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{N}A_{i}$ different arrangements. Your task is to calculate the sum of the number of $good pairs$ of all different arrangements. As the answer can be rather large, find remainder after dividing the number by $1000000007({10}^{9}+7)$.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases.<br>In each test case:<br>The first line contains a integer $N(1\\leq N\\leq 100000)$.
