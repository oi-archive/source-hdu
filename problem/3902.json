His dream is to be the best swordsman in the world. To achieve his goal, he practices every day. There are many ways to practice, but Mr. AC likes &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Perfect Cut&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; very much. The &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Perfect Cut&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; can be described as the following two steps:<br>1.&#xA0;&#xA0;Put a piece of wood block on the desk, and then suddenly wave the sword, cutting the block into two pieces.<br>2.&#xA0;&#xA0;Without any motion, the two pieces must be absolutely axial symmetry.<br>According to the step two, when the board is an axial symmetry figure, Mr. AC has a chance to achieve the &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Perfect Cut&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;. Now give you a board, and you should tell if Mr. AC has a chance to complete the &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Perfect Cut&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;. The board is a simple polygon.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several cases. <br>The first line of one case contains a single integer n (3 &lt;= n &lt;= 20000), the number of points.
