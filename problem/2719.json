Certain characters are reserved within URIs, and if a reserved character is part of an identifier then it must be percent-encoded by replacing it with a percent sign followed by two hexadecimal digits representing the ASCII code of the character. A table of seven reserved characters and their encodings is shown below. Your job is to write a program that can percent-encode a string of characters.<br><br>Character&#xA0;&#xA0;Encoding<br>&quot; &quot; (space)&#xA0;&#xA0;%20<br>&quot;!&quot; (exclamation point)&#xA0;&#xA0;%21<br>&quot;$&quot; (dollar sign)&#xA0;&#xA0;%24<br>&quot;%&quot; (percent sign)&#xA0;&#xA0;%25<br>&quot;(&quot; (left parenthesis)&#xA0;&#xA0;%28<br>&quot;)&quot; (right parenthesis)&#xA0;&#xA0;%29<br>&quot;*&quot; (asterisk)&#xA0;&#xA0;%2a<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of one or more strings, each 1&#x2013;79 characters long and on a line by itself, followed by a line containing only &quot;#&quot; that signals the end of the input.
