A LAN is useful for sharing resources like files, printers, games or other applications. A LAN in turn often connects to other LANs, and to the Internet or other WAN. <br>In this contest, everybody is connecting with each others like the following figure.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C95-1003-1.jpg\"></center><br><br>The contest&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s network was built as N rows and M columns, your computer locate at (0, 0) and the judger&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s computer locate at <font color=\"#ff0000\">(m-1, n-1)</font> The code you submit would only transfer to up or right smoothly.
