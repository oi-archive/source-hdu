He wants to charge them with Balala Power (he could change each character ranged from <b>a</b> to <b>z</b> into each number ranged from <b>0</b> to <b>25</b>, but each two different characters should not be changed into the same number) so that he could calculate the sum of these strings as integers in base $26$ hilariously.<br><br><b>Mr.Tang</b> wants you to maximize the summation. Notice that no string in this problem could have leading zeros except for string &quot;0&quot;. It is guaranteed that at least one character does not appear at the beginning of any string.<br><br>The summation may be quite large, so you should output it in modulo $10^9 + 7$.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains multiple test cases.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains one positive integers $n$, the number of strings. $(1 \\leq n \\leq 100000)$<br><br>Each of the next $n$ lines contains a string $s_i$ consisting of only lower case letters. $(1 \\leq |s_i| \\leq 100000, \\sum{|s_i|} \\leq 10^6)$<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output &quot;<b>Case #$x$: $y$</b>&quot; in one line (without quotes), where $x$ indicates the case number starting from $1$ and $y$ denotes the answer of corresponding case.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\na\n2\naa\nbb\n3\na\nba\nabc</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 25\nCase #2: 1323\nCase #3: 18221</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2017+Multi-University+Training+Contest+-+Team+1&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2017 Multi-University Training Contest - Team 1 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
