Unfortunately, it broke down. Your task is to write a super computing software to take its place. The software contains 10 registers named from A to J. There are three operations on the registers:<br>1) Assignment: <b>X</b>=<b>Y</b><br>2) Addition:  <b>X</b>+=<b>Y</b><br>3) Multiplication: <b>X</b>*=<b>Y</b><br>Notice that <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> are two registers, and they may be the same. <br>Initially, all the registers are stored by integer 1. Your program should operate several operations and output the final result for 10 registers. You may assume that the length of each decimal number stored in the register is no longer than 5000.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains only one test case including several lines.<br>Each line contains an operation to be calculated.<br>The number of operations will no more than 300000.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"The output should contains exactly 10 lines, each line contains an integer denoting the decimal number in the register.
