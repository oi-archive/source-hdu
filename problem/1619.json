For example, one of the constraints in VLSI routing problems is minimizing wire length. The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) -- finding whether all the cities in a salesperson&apos;s route can be visited exactly once with a specified limit on travel time -- is one of the canonical examples of an NP-complete problem; solutions appear to require an inordinate amount of time to generate, but are simple to check. <br><br>This problem deals with finding a minimal path through a grid of points while traveling only from left to right. <br><br>Given an m*n  matrix of integers, you are to write a program that computes a path of minimal weight. A path starts anywhere in column 1 (the first column) and consists of a sequence of steps terminating in column n (the last column). A step consists of traveling from column i to column i+1 in an adjacent (horizontal or diagonal) row. The first and last rows (rows 1 and m) of a matrix are considered adjacent, i.e., the matrix ``wraps&apos;&apos; so that it represents a horizontal cylinder. Legal steps are illustrated below. <br><br><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1619-1.gif\"><br><br>The weight of a path is the sum of the integers in each of the n cells of the matrix that are visited. <br><br>For example, two slightly different  5*6 matrices are shown below (the only difference is the numbers in the bottom row). <br><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1619-2.gif\"><br><br><br>The minimal path is illustrated for each matrix. Note that the path for the matrix on the right takes advantage of the adjacency property of the first and last rows. <br><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of a sequence of matrix specifications. Each matrix specification consists of the row and column dimensions in that order on a line followed by  integers where m is the row dimension and n is the column dimension. The integers appear in the input in row major order, i.e., the first n integers constitute the first row of the matrix, the second n integers constitute the second row and so on. The integers on a line will be separated from other integers by one or more spaces. Note: integers are not restricted to being positive. There will be one or more matrix specifications in an input file. Input is terminated by end-of-file. <br><br>For each specification the number of rows will be between 1 and 10 inclusive; the number of columns will be between 1 and 100 inclusive.
