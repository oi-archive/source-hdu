On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap.<br>---Wikipedia<br><br>Today, Nim takes revenge on you, again. As you know, the rule of Nim game is rather unfair, only the nim-sum (&#x2295;) of the sizes of the heaps is zero will the first player lose. To ensure the fairness of the game, the second player has a chance to move some (can be zero) heaps before the game starts, but he has to move one heap entirely, i.e. not partially. Of course, he can&#x2019;t move all heaps out, at least one heap should be left for playing. Will the second player have the chance to win this time?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer T, indicating the number of test cases. <br><br>Each test case begins with an integer N, indicating the number of heaps.
