If at the i-th second, a condition is given to the monitor, then the monitor will give an alert at the j-th second reporting that the condition given at the i-th second is met. Here j is the minimum integer such that the numbers generated by the generator from the i-th second to the j-th second and in range [ $l_i, r_i$ ] equals to $c_i$ . Otherwise, the generator will generate a number $a_i$ . However, the monitor stops working now. We need you to write a program to give the alerts.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.<br>For each test case, the first line contains an integer m and n.
