He came to the kingdom of numbers and solicited an audience with the king. He recounted how he had built a happy path in the kingdom of happiness. The king affirmed Welly&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s talent and hoped that this talent can help him find the best infinite fraction path before the anniversary.<br>The kingdom has N cities numbered from 0 to N - 1 and you are given an array D[0 ... N - 1] of decimal digits (0 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; D[i] &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 9, D[i] is an integer). The destination of the only one-way road start from the i-th city is the city labelled ($i^2$ + 1)%N.<br>A path beginning from the i-th city would pass through the cities $u_1, u_2, u_3$, and so on consecutively. The path constructs a real number A[i], called the relevant fraction such that the integer part of it is equal to zero and its fractional part is an infinite decimal fraction with digits D[i], D[$u_1$], D[$u_2$], and so on.<br>The best infinite fraction path is the one with the largest relevant fraction","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains multiple test cases and the first line provides an integer up to 100 indicating to the total numberof test cases.<br>For each test case, the first line contains the integer N (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 150000).
