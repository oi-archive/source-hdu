We number the row from top to bottom 0,1,2,&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;and the column from left to right 0,1,2,&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;.If using C(n,k) represents the number of row n, column k. The Yang Hui Triangle has a regular pattern as follows.<br>C(n,0)=C(n,n)=1 (n &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 0) <br>C(n,k)=C(n-1,k-1)+C(n-1,k) (0&lt;k&lt;n)<br>Write a program that calculates the minimum sum of numbers passed on a route that starts at the top and ends at row n, column k. Each step can go either straight down or diagonally down to the right like figure 2.<br>As the answer may be very large, you only need to output the answer mod p which is a prime.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input to the problem will consists of series of up to 100000 data sets.
