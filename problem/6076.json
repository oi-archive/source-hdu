Checking a person needs one minute, and two queues can be checked at the same time.<br><br><center><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C762-1010-1.jpg\"><br>Picture from Wikimedia Commons<br></center> <br><br>Two teams $A$ and $B$ are going to travel by plane. Each team has $n$ players, ranked from $1$ to $n$ according to their average performance. No two players in the same team share the same rank. Team $A$ is waiting in queue $1$ while team $B$ is waiting in queue $2$. Nobody else is waiting for security check.<br><br>Little Q is the policeman who manages two queues. Every time he can check one person from one queue, or check one each person from both queues at the same time. He can&apos;t change the order of the queue, because that will make someone unhappy. Besides, if two players $A_i$ and $B_j$ are being checked at the same time, satisfying $|A_i-B_j|\\leq k$, they will make a lot of noise because their rank are almost the same. Little Q should never let that happen.<br><br>Please write a program to help Little Q find the best way costing the minimum time.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T(1\\leq T\\leq15)$, denoting the number of test cases.<br><br>In each test case, there are $2$ integers $n,k(1\\leq n\\leq 60000,1\\leq k\\leq 10)$ in the first line, denoting the number of players in a team and the parameter $k$.<br><br>In the next line, there are $n$ distinct integers $A_1,A_2,...,A_n(1\\leq A_i\\leq n)$, denoting the queue $1$ from front to rear.<br><br>Then in the next line, there are $n$ distinct integers $B_1,B_2,...,B_n(1\\leq B_i\\leq n)$, denoting the queue $2$ from front to rear.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print a single line containing an integer, denoting the minimum time to check all people.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n4 2\n2 3 1 4\n1 2 4 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">7\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nTime 1 : Check A_1.\nTime 2 : Check A_2.\nTime 3 : Check A_3.\nTime 4 : Check A_4 and B_1.\nTime 5 : Check B_2.\nTime 6 : Check B_3.\nTime 7 : Check B_4.\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2017+Multi-University+Training+Contest+-+Team+4&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2017 Multi-University Training Contest - Team 4 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
