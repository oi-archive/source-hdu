The box is made of n*m grids. There are sparking jewel in some grids. But the top and bottom of the box is locked by amazing magic, so Harry can&#x2019;t see the inside from the top or bottom. However, four sides of the box are transparent, so Harry can see the inside from the four sides. Seeing from the left of the box, Harry finds each row is shining(it means each row has at least one jewel). And seeing from the front of the box, each column is shining(it means each column has at least one jewel).
