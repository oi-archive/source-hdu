He has determined that canceling the common digit of a numerator and denominator produces the correct answer. Of course, Sir Bedavere only tried this on a small sample of three digit numbers. An example of what he did is shown in the following division problem (in which he canceled the common 6):<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C238-1003-2.jpg\"></center><br>Your task is to find all three digit number combinations with the following property:<br><br>number combinations where removing the rightmost digit from the top number (numerator) and the identical leftmost digit from the bottom number (denominator) leaves the result of the calculation unchanged.<br><br>Omit all of the trivial cases &#x2014; xxx/xxx = xx/xx (222/222 = 22/22). The solutions are to be shown in increasing order of the top number (the numerator).<br><br><div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div><sup>1</sup>&#xA0;Please see the scene &quot;How do you know she&apos;s a witch?&quot; or recall the quote &quot;&#x2026;how sheep&apos;s bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.&quot;</div>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"NONE!
