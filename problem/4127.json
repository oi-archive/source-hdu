The player starts from the top left corner. At each step, he/she selects a color and changes all the grids connected with the top left corner to that specific color. The statement &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;two grids are connected&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; means that there is a path between the certain two grids under condition that each pair of adjacent grids on this path is in the same color and shares an edge. In this way the player can flood areas of the board from the starting grid (top left corner) until all of the grids are in same color.
