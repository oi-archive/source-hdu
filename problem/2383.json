As a precaution, you always take your mobile phone with you, so you can call for help in case of an emergency. However, it only works as long as you stay in range of (one of) the phone towers in the area. Fortunately, you know precisely where you are and where you are going, and you brought a map of the area showing the locations of the mobile phone towers. You want to take the shortest route home, while staying in range of at least one of those towers. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"On the first line an integer t (1 &lt;= t &lt;= 100): the number of test cases.
