The distance between two positive integers x and y, denoted by d(x, y), is defined as the minimum number of multiplications by a prime or divisions (without a remainder) by a prime one can perform to transform x into y. For example, d(15, 50) = 3, because 50 = 15 * 2 * 5 / 3, and you have to perform two multiplications (*2, *5) and one division (/3) to transform 15 into 50.<br><br>For a set S of positive integers, which is initially empty, you are asked to implement the following types of operations on S.<br><br>1.&#xA0;&#xA0;I x: Insert x into S. If x is already in S, just ignore this operation.<br>2.&#xA0;&#xA0;D x: Delete x from S. If x is not in S, just ignore this operation.<br>3.&#xA0;&#xA0;Q x: Find out a minimum z such that there exists a y in S and d(x, y) = z.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains multiple test cases.
