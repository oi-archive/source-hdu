The very same label would gently ask the customer to calmly head to the nearest Machine (that should hopefully<br>work fine).<br><br><br>In order to do so, a list of two-dimensional locations of all n ATMs has been prepared, and your task is to find for each of them the one closest with respect to the Euclidean distance.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases. The very first line contains the number of cases t (t &lt;= 15) that follow. Each test cases begin with the number of Cash Machines n (2 &lt;= n &lt;= 10^5). Each of the next n lines contain the coordinates of one Cash Machine x,y (0 &lt;= x,y &lt;=10^9) separated by a space.
