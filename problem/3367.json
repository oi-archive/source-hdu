The maximal pseudoforests of G are the pseudoforest subgraphs of G that are not contained within any larger pseudoforest of G. A pesudoforest is larger than another if and only if the total value of the edges is greater than another one&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s.<br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers, n(0 &lt; n &lt;= 10000), m(0 &lt;= m &lt;= 100000), which are the number of the vertexes and the number of the edges. The next m lines, each line consists of three integers, u, v, c, which means there is an edge with value c (0 &lt; c &lt;= 10000) between u and v. You can assume that there are no loop and no multiple edges.<br>The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeros, which means the end of the input.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Output the sum of the value of the edges of the maximum pesudoforest.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3 3\n0 1 1\n1 2 1\n2 0 1\n4 5\n0 1 1\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3 0 1\n0 2 2\n0 0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n5</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=%A1%B0%B9%E2%CD%A5%B1%AD%A1%B1%B5%DA%CE%E5%BD%EC%BB%AA%D6%D0%B1%B1%C7%F8%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%D1%FB%C7%EB%C8%FC+%F4%DF+WHU%B5%DA%B0%CB%BD%EC%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%BE%BA%C8%FC&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x365;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xCEEA;&#xFFFD;&#x431;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; WHU&#xFFFD;&#x6B0;&#x2FD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x1BE;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
