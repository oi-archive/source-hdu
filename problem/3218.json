One day LMY wrote down an integer 3 and two polynomials <img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/3218-1.jpg\">and<img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/3218-2.jpg\">on a piece of paper. <br>YY noticed that 3 is a prime. Besides, he found that f(x) has a degree strictly less than g(x). And all coefficients of the two polynomials are between 0 and 2, <br>inclusively. His most important discovery is, that there is a polynomial <img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/3218-3.jpg\"> , such that<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/3218-4.jpg\"></center><br>Then YY added a restriction: all coefficients of h(x) must be between 0 and 2 inclusively, and its degree must be less than g(x). Finally, he found that the polynomial<br> h(x) with such properties is unique.<br><br>The property that a polynomial f(x) with all its coefficients between 0 and p-1 inclusively, where p is a prime number, is called that f(x) is in the polynomial ring<br> defined on field Zp. Note that<img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/3218-5.jpg\">. Such a polynomial ring is called Zp[x].<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/3218-6.jpg\"></center><br>Then h(x) is called a multiplicative inverse of f(x), defined on the quotient ring Zp[x]/(g(x)). YY wonders if such an inverse always exists and is unique.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Input contains multiple test cases.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains a prime number p.<br><br>The following line consists of two positive integers n and m (n&lt;m), indicating the degrees of f(x) and g(x).<br><br>The following line contains n+1 integers, a0, a1&#x2026; an, indicating the coefficients of f(x), i.e.,<img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/3218-7.jpg\">.
