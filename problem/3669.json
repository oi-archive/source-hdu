All people in Rectland can be considered as rectangles with varying width and height, and they can only dig rectangle holes in the wall. A person can pass through a hole, if and only if the person&#x2019;s width and height is no more than the hole&#x2019;s width and height both. To dig a hole with width W and height H, the people should pay W * H dollars. Please note that it is only permitted to dig at most K holes for security consideration, and different holes cannot overlap each other in the Great Wall. Remember when they pass through the wall, they must have their feet landed on the ground.<br>Given all the persons&#x2019; width and height, you are requested to find out the minimum cost for digging holes to make all the persons pass through the wall.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases.
