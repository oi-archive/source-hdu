See, he is painting again, this time on home&apos;s white wall, using different color of paint. Let me see, red, yellow, black, green... but why does he just paint rectangles? Pretty guy, seems he is fond of it.<br><br>So, after he&apos;s done his great job, the white wall has been filled with so many blocks of color. Of course, some color previously painted has been covered by some color painted later. Now, the little guy has some doubt that how many different colors have been left on the wall, and what are the areas of them. As a seven-year-old boy, he has just learned painting in kindergarten, math seems too difficult for him. So he turns to you, a college student good at math and programming, to help him figuring it out. Don&apos;t make him disappointed.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Input consists of multiple test cases, each describing &quot;a great job&quot; done by out little guy.<br><br>Each case begins with a line containing two integers, Height and Width, the size of the wall. The next line contains an integer N, which is the number of rectangles that have been painted. N lines follow, describing the rectangles in the order they were painted.

Bottom is strictly greater than Top, and Right is strictly greater than Left.
