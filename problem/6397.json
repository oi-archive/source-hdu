Since computers can only process numbers, number codes are used to represent characters, which is known as character encoding. A character encoding system establishes a bijection between the elements of an alphabet of a certain size $n$ and integers from $0$ to $n-1$. Some well known character encoding systems include American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), which has an alphabet size 128, and the extended ASCII, which has an alphabet size 256.<br><br>For example, in ASCII encoding system, the word $\\texttt{wdy}$ is encoded as [119, 100, 121], while $\\texttt{jsw}$ is encoded as [106, 115, 119]. It can be noticed that both $119+100+121=340$ and $106+115+119=340$, thus the sum of the encoded numbers of the two words are equal. In fact, there are in all 903 such words of length 3 in an encoding system of alphabet size 128 (in this example, ASCII). The problem is as follows: given an encoding system of alphabet size $n$ where each character is encoded as a number between 0 and $n-1$ inclusive, how many different words of length $m$ are there, such that the sum of the encoded numbers of all characters is equal to $k$?<br><br>Since the answer may be large, you only need to output it modulo 998244353.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input is a single integer $T$ $(1 \\leq T \\leq 400)$, the number of test cases.<br><br>Each test case includes a line of three integers $n, m, k$ $(1 \\leq n,m \\leq 10^5, 0 \\leq k \\leq 10^5)$, denoting the size of the alphabet of the encoding system, the length of the word, and the required sum of the encoded numbers of all characters, respectively.<br><br>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$, the sum of $m$ and the sum of $k$ don&apos;t exceed $5 \\times 10^6$, respectively.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, display the answer modulo 998244353 in a single line.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4\n2 3 3\n2 3 4\n3 3 3\n128 3 340</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n0\n7\n903</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2018+Multi-University+Training+Contest+8&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2018 Multi-University Training Contest 8 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
