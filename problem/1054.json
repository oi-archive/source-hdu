Now he has the following problem. He must defend a medieval city, the roads of which form a tree. He has to put the minimum number of soldiers on the nodes so that they can observe all the edges. Can you help him?<br><br>Your program should find the minimum number of soldiers that Bob has to put for a given tree.<br><br>The input file contains several data sets in text format. Each data set represents a tree with the following description:<br><br>the number of nodes<br>the description of each node in the following format<br>node_identifier:(number_of_roads) node_identifier1 node_identifier2 ... node_identifier<br>or<br>node_identifier:(0)<br><br>The node identifiers are integer numbers between 0 and n-1, for n nodes (0 &lt; n &lt;= 1500). Every edge appears only once in the input data.<br><br>For example for the tree: <br><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1054-1.gif\"> <br><br>the solution is one soldier ( at the node 1).<br><br>The output should be printed on the standard output. For each given input data set, print one integer number in a single line that gives the result (the minimum number of soldiers). An example is given in the following table:<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4\n0:(1) 1\n1:(2) 2 3\n2:(0)\n3:(0)\n5\n3:(3) 1 4 2\n1:(1) 0\n2:(0)\n0:(0)\n4:(0)</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=Southeastern+Europe+2000&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> Southeastern Europe 2000 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
