The first digit (from 1 to 4) represents the suit of the card, and the second digit (from 1 to 7) represents the value of the card.<br><br>First, you shu2e the cards and lay them face up on the table in four rows of seven cards, leaving a space of one card at the extreme left of each row. The following shows an example of initial layout.<br><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1067-1.gif\"><br><br>Next, you remove all cards of value 1, and put them in the open space at the left end of the rows: &quot;11&quot; to the top row, &quot;21&quot; to the next, and so on.<br><br>Now you have 28 cards and four spaces, called gaps, in four rows and eight columns. You start moving cards from this layout.<br><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1067-2.gif\"><br><br>At each move, you choose one of the four gaps and fill it with the successor of the left neighbor of the gap. The successor of a card is the next card in the same suit, when it exists. For instance the successor of &quot;42&quot; is &quot;43&quot;, and &quot;27&quot; has no successor.<br><br>In the above layout, you can move &quot;43&quot; to the gap at the right of &quot;42&quot;, or &quot;36&quot; to the gap at the right of &quot;35&quot;. If you move &quot;43&quot;, a new gap is generated to the right of &quot;16&quot;. You cannot move any card to the right of a card of value 7, nor to the right of a gap.<br><br>The goal of the game is, by choosing clever moves, to make four ascending sequences of the same suit, as follows.<br><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1067-3.gif\"><br><br>Your task is to find the minimum number of moves to reach the goal layout.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input starts with a line containing the number of initial layouts that follow.<br><br>Each layout consists of five lines - a blank line and four lines which represent initial layouts of four rows.
