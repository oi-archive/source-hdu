It is common that the athletes run very fast at first but slow down later on. Start from this moment, we can assume that everyone is moving forward in a constant speed. ACMers love algorithms, so they want to know not only the result but also who may be in the leading position. Now we know all athletes&apos; position and speed at a specific moment. The problem is, starting from this moment, how many athletes may be the leader. Please notice that there&apos;s no leader if two or more athletes are at the leading position at the same time. No two athletes may have the same speed.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases.
