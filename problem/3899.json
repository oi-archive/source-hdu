The contest was always held in the college of software in the past. However, they changed their minds and decided to find the most convenient location from all colleges this year.<br>Each college in JLU is located in one of the N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100,000) different locations (labeled as 1 to N) connected by N-1 roads. Any two colleges are reachable to each other. The Contest can be held at any one of these N colleges. Moreover, Road i connects college A_i and B_i (1 &lt;= A_i &lt;=N; 1 &lt;= B_i &lt;= N) and has length L_i (1 &lt;= L_i &lt;= 1,000). College i has T_i (0 &lt;= T_i &lt;= 1,000) teams participating in the contest.<br>When choosing the college to hold the Contest, Dr. Skywind wishes to minimize the inconvenience of the chosen location. The inconvenience of choosing college P is the sum of the distance that all teams need to reach college P (i.e., if the distance from college i to college P is 20, then the travel distance is T_i*20). Please help Dr. Skywind and Dr. Walkoncloud to choose the most convenient location for the contest.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
