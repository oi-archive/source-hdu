It can move horizontally or  vertically along the chess grid. At each move, it can either simply move to another empty cell in the same line without any other chessman along the route or perform an eat action. The eat action, however, is the main concern in this problem. <br>An eat action, for example, Cannon A eating chessman B, requires two conditions: <br>1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;A and B is in either the same row or the same column in the chess grid. <br>2&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;There is exactly one chessman between A and B. <br>Here comes the problem.  <br>Given  an  N  x  M  chess  grid,  with  some  existing  chessmen  on  it,  you  need  put maximum cannon pieces into the grid, satisfying that any two cannons are not able to eat each other. It is worth nothing that we only account the cannon pieces you put in the grid, and no two pieces shares the same cell.  ","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases. <br>In each test case, there are three positive integers N, M and Q (1&lt;= N, M&lt;=5, 0&lt;=Q &lt;= N x M) in the first line, indicating the row number, column number of the grid, and the number of the existing chessmen. <br>In the second line, there are Q pairs of integers. Each pair of integers X, Y indicates the row index and the column index of the piece. Row indexes are numbered from 0 to N-1, and column indexes are numbered from 0 to M-1. It guarantees no pieces share the same cell.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"There is only one line for each test case, containing the maximum number of cannons.
