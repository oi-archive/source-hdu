So I started traveling.<br><br>The nation looks like a connected bidirectional graph, and I am randomly walking on it. It means when I am at node i, I will travel to an adjacent node with the same probability in the next step. I will pick up the start node randomly (each node in the graph has the same probability.), and travel for d steps, noting that I may go through some nodes multiple times.<br><br>If I miss some sights at a node, it will make me unhappy. So I wonder for each node, what is the probability that my path doesn&apos;t contain it.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of the test cases.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains 3 integers n, m and d, denoting the number of vertices, the number of edges and the number of steps respectively.
