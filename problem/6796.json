For each positive integer $x$, if there exists only one type of digit $d$ $(0 \\leq d \\leq 9)$ that occurs in $x$ with the highest frequency, then we say $x$ should be classified into category $d$, or otherwise, in case such digit doesn&apos;t exist, we say $x$ should be classified into category $10$.<br><br>For example,<br><br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x25CF; $111223$ should be classified into category $1$ since digit $1$ occurs three times, and digits $2$ and $3$ occur less than three times respectively, and<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x25CF; $3345544$ should be classified into category $4$ since digit $4$ occurs three times, and digits $3$ and $5$ occur less than three times respectively, and<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x25CF; $112233$ should be classified into category $10$ since digits $1$, $2$ and $3$ occur twice respectively.<br><br>Little W doesn&apos;t care about category $10$ and he just wants Teitoku to tell him the number of integers ranged from $l$ to $r$ that should be classified to another category $d$.
