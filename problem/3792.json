It is easy to see that d1 = 1 and dn=even for n&gt;1. Twin Prime Conjecture states that &quot;There are infinite consecutive primes differing by 2&quot;.<br>Now given any positive integer N (&lt; 10^5), you are supposed to count the number of twin primes which are no greater than N.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Your program must read test cases from standard input.<br>The input file consists of several test cases. Each case occupies a line which contains one integer N. The input is finished by a negative N.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, your program must output to standard output.
