It&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s hard to say which gender of those fish are, because every fish believes itself as a male, and it may attack one of some other fish who is believed to be female by it.<br>A fish will spawn after it has been attacked. Each fish can attack one other fish and can only be attacked once. No matter a fish is attacked or not, it can still try to attack another fish which is believed to be female by it.<br>There is a value we assigned to each fish and the spawns that two fish spawned also have a value which can be calculated by XOR operator through the value of its parents.<br>We want to know the maximum possibility of the sum of the spawns.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of multiply test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (0 &lt; n &lt;= 100), which is the number of the fish. The next line consists of n integers, indicating the value (0 &lt; value &lt;= 100) of each fish. The next n lines, each line contains n integers, represent a 01 matrix. The i-th fish believes the j-th fish is female if and only if the value in row i and column j if 1.<br>The last test case is followed by a zero, which means the end of the input.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Output the value for each test in a single line.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n1 2 3\n011\n101\n110\n0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">6</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"momodi@whu","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=The+5th+Guangting+Cup+Central+China+Invitational+Programming+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> The 5th Guangting Cup Central China Invitational Programming Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
