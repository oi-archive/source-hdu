The chessboard is an unexplored territory. In the spirit of explorers, whoever stands on a square for the first time claims the ownership of this square. The knight initially owns the square he stands, and jumps $N$ times before he gets bored.<br>Recall that a knight can jump in 8 directions. Each direction consists of two squares forward and then one squaure sidways.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C787-1011-1.jpg\"></center><br>After $N$ jumps, how many squares can possibly be claimed as territory of the knight? As $N$ can be really large, this becomes a nightmare to the knight who is not very good at math.
