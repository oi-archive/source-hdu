The radius of the ball is $10^{-1000}$, which is so small that the ball can be treated as a point.<br><br>In order to clearly describe the position of the ball, we build a plane coordinate system based on this triangle. The original point is at the midpoint of the triangle&apos;s bottom edge, the X-axis is along with the bottom edge (from left to right), and the Y-axis is along with the height on the bottom edge (from bottom to top). For example, the vertices of the triangle are at the positions $\\left(-\\frac{L}{2}, 0\\right)$, $\\left(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3} L}{2}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\frac{L}{2}, 0\\right)$ respectively.<br><br>At the beginning, the speed of the ball in the horizontal direction is $v_x$ per second, and that in the vertical direction is $v_y$ per second, in other words, the original speed of the ball is $\\sqrt{{v_x}^2 + {v_y}^2}$, along with the direction vector $(v_x, v_y)$.<br><br>If the ball is now at the position $(x, y)$, then it will move to the position $(x + t \\cdot v_x, y + t \\cdot v_y)$ after $t$ seconds, if it does not touch the border during this process.<br><br> <center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C881-1008-2.png\"></center>  <br><br>When the ball hits any edge of the border, a completely elastic collision occurs, which means the moving direction of this ball will change according to the law of reflection, but its speed will not.<br><br>The law of reflection follows the rule of &quot;incident angle equals reflection angle&quot;. As depicted in the picture above, the incident angle $\\alpha$ is equal to the reflection angle $\\beta$.<br><br>Now given the side length $L$ of this triangle, the ball&apos;s position $(x, y)$ and its speed $(v_x, v_y)$ at the beginning, can you calculate the time when the $k$-th collision occurs?<br><br>It is guaranteed that the ball does not touch any vertex of the triangle within the first $k$ collisions.<br><br> <center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C881-1008-1.png\"></center>  <br><br>But after the first $k$ collisions, the ball may touch any vertex of the triangle, for example, in the third sample case.<br><br>The claim that the ball does not touch any vertex of the triangle means that the distances from the ball to the nearest two sides of the triangle will not equal to the ball&apos;s radius at the same time.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases.<br><br>The first line contains an integer $T$ $(1 \\leq T \\leq 10^4)$, denoting the number of test cases.
