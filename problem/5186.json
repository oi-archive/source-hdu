He knows that on the $i^{th}$ oj, he made $a_i$ submissions. And what you should do is to add them up.<br>To make the problem more complex, zhx gives you $n$ $B-base$ numbers and you should also return a $B-base$ number to him.<br>What&apos;s more, zhx is so naive that he doesn&apos;t carry a number while adding. That means, his answer to $5 + 6$ in $10-base$ is $1$. And he also asked you to calculate in his way.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Multiply test cases(less than $1000$).
