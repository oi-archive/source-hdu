We know that a gene is made of DNA. The nucleotide bases from which DNA is built are A(adenine), C(cytosine), G(guanine), and T(thymine). Finding the longest common subsequence between DNA/Protein sequences is one of the basic problems in modern computational molecular biology. But this problem is a little different. Given several DNA sequences, you are asked to make a shortest sequence from them so that each of the given sequence is the subsequence of it.<br><br>For example, given &quot;ACGT&quot;,&quot;ATGC&quot;,&quot;CGTT&quot; and &quot;CAGT&quot;, you can make a sequence in the following way. It is the shortest but may be not the only one.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../data/images/C50-1006-1.jpg\"></center>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is the test case number t.
