The separation between adjacent lines is D (D&gt;0). Now considering a circle of diameter D. N points lie on or in the circle. It is guaranteed that any three points are not collinear. Between any two points there&apos;s a needle. Find the possibility that, if the circle is randomly (with equal probability on any position and direction) thrown onto the same plane described above (with the equally-spaced parallel lines of separation d), at least one needle crosses a line.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The first line contains a single integer T (1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100), the number of test cases.<br><br>   For each set of input data, the first line gives two integers, N and D (N&lt;=100), as described above. <b>You can consider the center of the circle is default as the origin.</b> Lastly N lines is followed, each containing two real numbers that representing the coordinate of a point lying within the circle.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"   Each output should occupy one line.
