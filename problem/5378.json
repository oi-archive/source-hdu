You can go to any city from any city. In other words, this land is a tree. The city numbered one is the root of this tree.<br><br>There are $n$ ministers numbered from $1$ to $n$. You will send them to $n$ cities, one city with one minister. <br><br>Since this is a rooted tree, each city is a root of a subtree and there are $n$ subtrees. The leader of a subtree is the minister with maximal number in this subtree. As you can see, one minister can be the leader of several subtrees. <br><br>One day all the leaders attend a meet, you find that there are exactly $k$ ministers. You want to know how many ways to send $n$ ministers to each city so that there are $ k$ ministers attend the meet.<br><br>Give your answer mod $1000000007$.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Multiple test cases.
