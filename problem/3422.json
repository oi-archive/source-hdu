So he decided to use 4 times of the balls he just used as a right-edge side of the right triangle(the three edges have no common factor).He only to pile the three edges,that is the middle is empty.But there will not have so many balls,so he wants to know the minimum of balls he must use.Now ,he turn to you for help.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The layer of the triangle as the promble describes n,1 &lt;= n &lt; 2^16","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"The minimum of balls he must use and the length of the hypotenuse.
