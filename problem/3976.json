You may assume that the circuit is connected. The equivalent resistance of the circuit between 1 and n is that, if you only consider node 1 as positive pole and node n as cathode , all the circuit could be regard as one resistance . (It&apos;s important to analyse complicated circuit ) At most one resistance will between any two nodes.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/3976-1.jpg\"></center> ","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"In the first line has one integer T indicates the number of test cases.
