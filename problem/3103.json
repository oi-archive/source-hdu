The levees partition the country into four quadrants. Each quadrant is identified by a pair of vertices representing the outside edge of that quadrant. For example, Quadrant 1 shown below is defined by the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) .<br><br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/con228-1004-2.JPG\"></center> <br><br>It happens very often that the country of Waterlogged becomes flooded, and the levees need to be reinforced, but their country is poor and they have limited resources. They would like to be able to reinforce those levees that encompass the largest area first, then the next largest second, then the next largest third, and the smallest area fourth.<br><br>Help Waterlogged identify which quadrants are the largest, and the length of the levees around them.
