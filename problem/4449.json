It is not an easy task, because they make some strange claims to the new building:<br>      1.Its shape should be the same as a convex polyhedron which they have given to you, though you can rotate it arbitrarily.<br>      2.One face of the building should cling to the ground. (Of course! Have you ever seen a building only touch the ground by an edge, or a point, or even suspend in the air?)<br>      3.They want the building to be as striking as possible. We call the highest point of the building as the &#x201C;peak&#x201D;. The higher the peak is the more striking the building will be.<br>      4.If there are many designs meet all claims above, the occupied land of the building should be less. In another word, the building&apos;s vertical projection area on the ground should be as small as possible.<br>      Now, give you the relative positions of vertices of the building, please design the building and tell them H &#x2013; the height of the peak, as well as S - the projection area of the building in your best design.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"      There are several test cases in the input.<br>      Each test case begins with one integer n (1 &#x2264; n &#x2264; 50), indicating the number of vertices of the building.<br>      Then n lines follow. Each line contains three integers x, y, z (-10000 &#x2264; x, y, z &#x2264; 10000), separated by spaces, indicating the relative positions of one vertex of the building.<br>      The input ends with n = 0.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"      For each test case, output two float numbers H and S in one line, separated by one space.<br>      Please round the results to three digits after decimal point.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">6\n1 0 0\n-1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 -1 0\n0 0 1\n0 0 -1\n0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1.155 1.732</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2012+Asia+JinHua+Regional+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2012 Asia JinHua Regional Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
