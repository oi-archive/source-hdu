There are $n$ integers at a board and he performs the following moves repeatedly:<br><br>1. He chooses three numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$ written at the board and erases them.<br>2. He chooses two numbers from the triple $a$, $b$ and $c$ and calculates their greatest common divisor, getting the number $d$ ($d$ maybe $\\gcd(a,b)$, $\\gcd(a,c)$ or $\\gcd(b, c)$).<br>3. He writes the number $d$ to the board two times.<br><br>It can be seen that after performing the move $n-2$ times, there will be only two numbers with the same value left on the board. Alex wants to know which numbers can left on the board possibly. Can you help him?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
