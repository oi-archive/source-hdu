So to get rid of it, you must solve the following problem:<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;Given a string S and its four substring a,b,c, and d. In a configuration, you can place four substrings exactly one position it occurs in S (they may overlap), and characters covered by at least one such substring is called &#x201C;covered&#x201D;.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;You should solve for minimum and maximum possible number of covered characters in a configuration.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;You may assume that s contains only lowercase letters, and is of length less than 4096. However, lengths of a,b,c, and d would never exceed 64.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br><sup>1</sup>An infamous Russian reversal<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"&#x3000;&#x3000;There are several test cases.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;For each test case there are 5 lines, denoting S,a,b,c, and d, respectively.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;Please process until the EOF (End Of File).<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"&#x3000;&#x3000;For each test case, please print a single line with two integers, first the minimum, then the maximum.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">hello\nhe\nl\nl\no\nabacaba\nab\nba\na\nc</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4 5\n4 6</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2012+ACM%2FICPC+Asia+Regional+Chengdu+Online&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2012 ACM/ICPC Asia Regional Chengdu Online </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
