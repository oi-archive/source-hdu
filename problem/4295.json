So to get rid of it, you must solve the following problem:<br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Given a string S and its four substring a,b,c, and d. In a configuration, you can place four substrings exactly one position it occurs in S (they may overlap), and characters covered by at least one such substring is called &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;covered&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;.<br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;You should solve for minimum and maximum possible number of covered characters in a configuration.<br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;You may assume that s contains only lowercase letters, and is of length less than 4096.
