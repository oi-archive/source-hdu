Stan, the first player, subtracts any positive multiple of the lesser of the two numbers from the greater of the two numbers, provided that the resulting number must be nonnegative. Then Ollie, the second player, does the same with the two resulting numbers, then Stan, etc., alternately, until one player is able to subtract a multiple of the lesser number from the greater to reach 0, and thereby wins. For example, the players may start with (25,7): <br><br>25 7<br>11 7<br>4 7<br>4 3<br>1 3<br>1 0 <br><br>an Stan wins. <br><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of a number of lines.
