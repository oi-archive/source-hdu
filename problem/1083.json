Each student visits zero, one or more than one courses. Your task is to determine whether it is possible to form a committee of exactly P students that satisfies simultaneously the conditions:<br><br>. every student in the committee represents a different course (a student can represent a course if he/she visits that course)<br><br>. each course has a representative in the committee<br><br>Your program should read sets of data from a text file. The first line of the input file contains the number of the data sets. Each data set is presented in the following format:<br><br>P N<br>Count1 Student1 1 Student1 2 ... Student1 Count1<br>Count2 Student2 1 Student2 2 ... Student2 Count2<br>...... <br>CountP StudentP 1 StudentP 2 ... StudentP CountP<br><br>The first line in each data set contains two positive integers separated by one blank: P (1 &lt;= P &lt;= 100) - the number of courses and N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 300) - the number of students. The next P lines describe in sequence of the courses . from course 1 to course P, each line describing a course. The description of course i is a line that starts with an integer Count i (0 &lt;= Count i &lt;= N) representing the number of students visiting course i. Next, after a blank, you&apos;ll find the Count i students, visiting the course, each two consecutive separated by one blank. Students are numbered with the positive integers from 1 to N.<br><br>There are no blank lines between consecutive sets of data. Input data are correct.<br><br>The result of the program is on the standard output. For each input data set the program prints on a single line &quot;YES&quot; if it is possible to form a committee and &quot;NO&quot; otherwise. There should not be any leading blanks at the start of the line.<br><br>An example of program input and output:","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n3 3\n3 1 2 3\n2 1 2\n1 1\n3 3\n2 1 3\n2 1 3\n1 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">YES\nNO </div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=Southeastern+Europe+2000&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> Southeastern Europe 2000 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
