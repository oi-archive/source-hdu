That is, for each i (2 &lt;= i &lt;= N) we want to know the largest K &gt; 1 (if there is one) such that the prefix of S with length i can be written as A<sup>K</sup> , that is A concatenated K times, for some string A. Of course, we also want to know the period K.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file consists of several test cases.
