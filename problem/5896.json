They keep a habit of running everyday, especially the Head King, because he isn&apos;t confident about his figure (please don&apos;t tell him~).<br><br>The Head King is going to build a new city, which contains $N$ towns. He want to build some bidirectional roads between some of the towns (each road connect two towns) and choose some of them to form his private running route. The Head King <b>can&apos;t accept more than one bidirectional roads between two towns</b>, because he has no sense of direction and it will make him bemused. He prefers enjoying the landscape changing while running, so he <b>can&apos;t stand any same road on his running route</b>. <br><br>Now, the Head King wants to know the total number of scheme of road constructing. Every scheme satisfies that there exist a town for him both to start and finish running(the running route contains at least one road).
