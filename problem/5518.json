The $i$-th fence is a line segment in the plane<br>whose two endpoints are $(x_{1i}, y_{1i})$ and $(x_{2i}, y_{2i})$. Two different fences<br>can only intersect at their endpoints.<br>The following picture shows an example layout of fences.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C645-1010-1.png\"></center><br><br>To make cows happy, John will decorate the fences with rope lights.<br>A fence can hang several rope lights paralleling to itself.<br>However, a light can not be used alone.<br>John can only make a decoration by using some lights together (we call it a <b>string of lights</b>) and these lights will form a circle to decorate some fences (a light corresponds to a fence).<br>In the example, he can use three lights decorate three fences numbered $1, 2, 5$ which form a circle.<br><br>A string of lights which decorate fences numbered $k_1,k_2,\\cdots,k_m$ costs John $\\sum_{i=1}^m p_{k_i}$ dollars. The total cost is the sum of costs of each string. Notice that the cost for more than one <b>strings of lights</b> should be accumulated.<br>In the example, suppose that he decorate the fences with two strings of lights. One string decorate three fences numbered $1, 2, 5$ and the other string decorate three fences numbered $1, 2, 3, 4$. Then the total cost should be $2\\times p_1+2\\times p_2+p_3+p_4+p_5 = 106$ dollars.<br><br>John can control the switch of <b>each string</b> of lights. He can switch on <b>all lights on that string</b> or switch off<br>all of them, but he cannot switch on some of they while keeping other lights on that string switched off.<br>For a fence, if even number of strings on it are switched on, then all the lights on that fence will not work; otherwise,<br>all of them work. We define the shape of lights as a combination of status of each fence (considering the fences lit or not). A shape of lights might be achieved by arrangements of lights. The following picture shows all possible shape of<br>lights in the example. (Dash lines stands for fences where lights work and the solid stands for fences where lights<br>don&apos;t work.)<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C645-1010-2.png\"></center><br><br>The cows love lights, but they are fickle too. They want the lights arranged to form<br>different shapes from day to day, so John need to make arrangement for decorations so that <b>every possible shapes</b> can be formed by switching on <b>some of</b> the strings of lights and switching off the others.<br>What is the minimum money John must spend to meet needs of cows.<br><br>In the example, he can decorate the fences with two strings of lights.<br>One string decorate three fences numbered $1, 2, 5$ and the other string decorate three fences numbered $1, 2, 3, 4$.<br>If he switch off all strings, then cows can get the first shape; if he switch on all strings, then cows can get the last shape; if he switch on only the first string, then then cows can get the third shape; if he switch on only the second string, then then cows can get the second shape. Thus, he can spend 106 dollars to meet need of cows, and it also<br>turns out to be the minimum cost.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer $t~(1\\le t\\le 8)$, meaning the total number of test cases.<br>For each test case, the first line of input contains $n~(1\\le n\\le 1000)$.
