One day LMY calculates 2n one by one, n=0, 1, 2,&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; and writes the results on a sheet of paper: 1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;2&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;4&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;8&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;16&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;32&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;64&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;128&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;256&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;512&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;1024&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<br><br>LMY discovers that for every consecutive 3 or 4 results, there must be one among them whose first digit is 1, and comes to the conclusion that the first digit of 2n isn&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t evenly distributed between 1 and 9, and the number of 1s exceeds those of others.
