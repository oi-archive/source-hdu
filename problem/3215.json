They like to find and solve interesting mathematic problems together. One day LMY calculates 2n one by one, n=0, 1, 2,&#x2026; and writes the results on a sheet of paper: 1&#xFF0C;2&#xFF0C;4&#xFF0C;8&#xFF0C;16&#xFF0C;32&#xFF0C;64&#xFF0C;128&#xFF0C;256&#xFF0C;512&#xFF0C;1024&#xFF0C;&#x2026;&#x2026;<br><br>LMY discovers that for every consecutive 3 or 4 results, there must be one among them whose first digit is 1, and comes to the conclusion that the first digit of 2n isn&#x2019;t evenly distributed between 1 and 9, and the number of 1s exceeds those of others. YY now intends to use statistics to prove LMY&#x2019;s discovery.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Input consists of one or more lines, each line describing one test case: an integer N, where 0&#x2264;N&#x2264;10000.<br><br>End of input is indicated by a line consisting of -1.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output a single line.
