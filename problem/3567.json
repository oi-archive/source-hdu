The tiles are numbered from 1 to 8 and each covers a grid. As you see, there is a blank grid which can be represented as an &apos;X&apos;. Tiles in grids having a common edge with the blank grid can be moved into that blank grid. This operation leads to an exchange of &apos;X&apos; with one tile.<br><br>We use the symbol &apos;r&apos; to represent exchanging &apos;X&apos; with the tile on its right side, and &apos;l&apos; for the left side, &apos;u&apos; for the one above it, &apos;d&apos; for the one below it.<br><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C301-1004-1.jpg\"><br><br>A state of the board can be represented by a string S using the rule showed below.<br><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C301-1004-2.jpg\"><br><br>The problem is to operate an operation list of &apos;r&apos;, &apos;u&apos;, &apos;l&apos;, &apos;d&apos; to turn the state of the board from state A to state B.
