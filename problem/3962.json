One day, sevenzero found a phenomenon called Microgene. Microgene is a special fragment in the DNA, and different Microgenes may have the same hereditary effect. Microgene works if and only if there are more than one Microgenes(Microgenes may overlap) with the same hereditary effect in the DNA. To finish his paper, sevenzero wants to know how many different DNAs with length L which contain the hereditary effect caused by Microgenes.<br><br>To simplify the problem, a DNA or a Microgene is considerd as a string consisting of character &apos;A&apos;, &apos;T&apos;, &apos;C&apos; and &apos;G&apos;. And a Microgene is in the DNA if the Microgene string is the substring of the DNA string. All Microgenes given are different and with the same hereditary effect.
