This game has been one of the world&apos;s most popular game in recent years. The world of Minecraft is made up of lots of $1 \\times 1 \\times 1$ blocks in a 3D map. Blocks are the basic units of structure in Minecraft, there are many types of blocks. A block can either be a clay, dirt, water, wood, air, ... or even a building material such as brick or concrete in this game.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C646-1012-1.jpg\"></center><br><center><b>Figure 1: A typical world in Minecraft.</b></center><br><br>Nyanko-san is one of the diehard fans of the game, what he loves most is to build monumental houses in the world of the game. One day, he found a flat ground in some place. Yes, a super flat ground without any roughness, it&apos;s really a lovely place to build houses on it. Nyanko-san decided to build on a $n \\times m$ big flat ground, so he drew a blueprint of his house, and found some building materials to build.<br><br>While everything seems goes smoothly, something wrong happened. Nyanko-san found out he had forgotten to prepare glass elements, which is a important element to decorate his house. Now Nyanko-san gives you his blueprint of house and asking for your help. Your job is quite easy, collecting a sufficient number of the glass unit for building his house. But first, you have to calculate how many units of glass should be collected.<br><br>There are $n$ rows and $m$ columns on the ground, an intersection of a row and a column is a $1 \\times 1$ square,and a square is a valid place for players to put blocks on. And to simplify this problem, Nynako-san&apos;s blueprint can be represented as an integer array $c_{i,j} (1\\le i \\le n, 1 \\le j \\le m)$. Which $c_{i,j}$ indicates the height of his house on the square of $i$-th row and $j$-th column. The number of glass unit that you need to collect is equal to the surface area of Nyanko-san&apos;s house(exclude the face adjacent to the ground).","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer $T$ indicating the total number of test cases.<br>First line of each test case is a line with two integers $n,m$.<br>The $n$ lines that follow describe the array of Nyanko-san&apos;s blueprint, the $i$-th of these lines has $m$ integers $c_{i,1}, c_{i,2}, ..., c_{i,m}$, separated by a single space.<br><br>$1 \\le T \\le 50$<br>$1 \\le n,m \\le 50$<br>$0 \\le c_{i,j} \\le 1000$","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, please output the number of glass units you need to collect to meet Nyanko-san&apos;s requirement in one line.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n3 3\n1 0 0\n3 1 2\n1 1 0\n3 3\n1 0 1\n0 0 0\n1 0 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">30\n20\n\n<center><img src=\"../../data/images/C646-1012-2.jpg\"></center>\n<center><b>Figure 2: A top view and side view image for sample test case 1.</b></center></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2015ACM%2FICPC%D1%C7%D6%DE%C7%F8%B3%A4%B4%BA%D5%BE-%D6%D8%CF%D6%C8%FC%A3%A8%B8%D0%D0%BB%B6%AB%B1%B1%CA%A6%B4%F3%A3%A9&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2015ACM/ICPC&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x57E;-&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x43B;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x2A6;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
