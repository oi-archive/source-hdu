The hook is made up of several consecutive metallic sticks which are of the same length.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C116-1010-1.JPG\"></center><br><br>Now Pudge wants to do some operations on the hook.<br><br>Let us number the consecutive metallic sticks of the hook from 1 to N. For each operation, Pudge can change the consecutive metallic sticks, numbered from X to Y, into cupreous sticks, silver sticks or golden sticks.<br>The total value of the hook is calculated as the sum of values of N metallic sticks. More precisely, the value for each kind of stick is calculated as follows:<br><br>For each cupreous stick, the value is 1.<br>For each silver stick, the value is 2.<br>For each golden stick, the value is 3.<br><br>Pudge wants to know the total value of the hook after performing the operations.<br>You may consider the original hook is made up of cupreous sticks.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases.
