Lycanthrope wants to escape from being captured; however, our Dwarven Sniper won&#x2019;t let him go! He will use the Silver Bullet to kill the Lycanthrope by only one shot! Yes, that&#x2019;s enough.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Lycanthrope is running on a line in the map with a constant speed and direction. The weapon range of the Silver Bullet is limited by L meters. Dwarven Sniper can run for a while freely, and then shoot Lycanthrope. In order to show his excellent shooting skill, Dwarven Sniper wants the Silver Bullet flying as far as possible. But don&#x2019;t forget the flying time of the Silver Bullet due to considerable weight of the bullet. And Dwarven Sniper wants to stop the hunting as quickly as possible. So if there is more than one way to show his excellent skill, he would choose the fastest way. In this problem we consider the Silver Bullet and Lycanthrope as two points.<br>    Now Dwarven Sniper wants to know the maximum length that the Silver Bullet can fly, and the shortest time that the hunting lasts. Specifically, the total hunting time is defined as the time interval from the start of hunting to the moment that the bullet hit Lycanthrope. Can you help him?<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C347-1004-1.jpg\"></center> ","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases.
