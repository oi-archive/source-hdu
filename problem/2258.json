Groups of two or more connected (orthogonally, not diagonally) blocks that are the same color may be removed from the board. When a group of blocks is removed, the blocks above those removed ones fall down into the empty space. When an entire column of blocks is removed, all the columns to the right of that column shift to the left to fill the empty columns. Points are scored whenever a group of blocks is removed. The number of points per block increases as the group becomes bigger. When N blocks are removed, N*(N-1) points are scored. <br><br>LL was interested in this game at one time, but he found it is so difficult to find the optimal scheme. So he always play the game with a greedy strategy: choose the largest group to remove and if there are more than one largest group with equal number of blocks, choose the one which contains the most preceding block ( (x1,y1) is in front of (x2,y2) if and only if (x1&lt;x2 || x1==x2 &amp;&amp; y1&lt;y2) ). Now, he want to know how many points he will get. Can you help him?
