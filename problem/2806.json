N (0&lt;N&lt;=1000) students have registered for the contest, and the teacher LCY has thought up M (0&lt;M&lt;=15) problems numbered from 1 to M. LCY is so familiar with the students that he can forecast the result of every student for the M problems.<br>Now he will select as many problems as possible from the M problems. And he want at least K (0&lt;=K&lt;=M) students to solve all problems. Will you compute the maximum number of problems he can choose? Output &quot;0&quot; if there is no selection can satisfy the condition.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"First line of each case contains three integers: N, M and K.
