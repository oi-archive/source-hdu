Yuta is worrying about this situation, so he gives Rikka some math tasks to practice. There is one of them:<br><br>Yuta has an undirected connected graph $G=\\langle V,E \\rangle$ with $n$ nodes and $n-1$ edges. Yuta can choose some edges in $E$ and remove them. It is clear that Yuta has $2^{n-1}$ different ways to remove.<br><br>Now, Yuta want to know the number of ways to remove the edges which make the maximum matching size of the remaining graph $G&#x2019;$ is divisible by $m$.<br><br>It is too difficult for Rikka. Can you help her?&#xA0;&#xA0;<br><br>An edge set $S$ is a match of $G=\\langle V,E \\rangle$ if and only if each nodes in $V$ connects to at most one edge in $S$. The maximum matching of graph $G$ is defined as the match of $G$ with the largest size.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a number $t(1 \\leq t \\leq 100)$, the number of the testcases.
