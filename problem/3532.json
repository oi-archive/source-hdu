Then player2 selects other two points B and C. A, B and C are different with each other. Now they get an angle B-A-C.<br><br>Player1 wants to make the angle as large as possible, while player2 wants to make the angle as small as possible.<br><br>Now you are supposed to find the max angle player1 can get, assuming play2 is c lever enough.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are many test cases. In each test case, the first line is an integer n (3 &lt;= n &lt;= 1001), which is the number of points on the plane. Then there are n lines. Each contains two floating number x, y, witch is the coordinate of one point. n &lt;= 0 denotes the end of input.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output just one line, containing the max angle player1 can get in degree format.
