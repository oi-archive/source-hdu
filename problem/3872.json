Every dragon ball has two properties: the type and energy. We can cut these balls into some segments ( these segments should not be empty). You can not change the order of these balls. In each segment, if there exists a ball which is not the right most one and its type is the same with the right most one ,this segment will explode. The energy of a segment is the energy of the ball with largest energy in this segment. Now please minimize the total energy of all these segments without explosion.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There will be T (T&lt;=10) test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line comes an Integer N (1&lt;=N&lt;=100000), the number of dragon balls. The second line contains N integer numbers, indicating the type of the dragon balls. The types will be a number between 1 and 100000.
