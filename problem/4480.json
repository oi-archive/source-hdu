N and M have the same meanings as above. K means there are exactly K unit squares which have value 1 on it, surely that the other unit squares have value 0 on it. Then there are following K lines and each line has two integer x (1 &lt;= x &lt;= N), y (1 &lt;= y &lt;= M), means that the unit square in row x and column y has value 1 on it.
