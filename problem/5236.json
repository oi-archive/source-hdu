Unfortunately this software is rather unstable, and it always crashes. DRD needs to write $n$ characters in his article. He can press a key to input a character at time $i+0.1$, where $i$ is an integer equal or greater than 0. But at every time $i-0.1$ for integer $i$ strictly greater than 0, World might crash with probability $p$ and DRD loses his work, so he maybe has to restart from his latest saved article. To prevent write it again and again, DRD can press Ctrl-S to save his document at time $i$. Due to the strange keyboard DRD uses, to press Ctrl-S he needs to press $x$ characters. If DRD has input his total article, he has to press Ctrl-S to save the document. <br><br>Since World crashes too often, now he is asking his friend ATM for the optimal strategy to input his article. A strategy is measured by its expectation keys DRD needs to press. <br><br>Note that DRD can press a key at fast enough speed. <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"First line: an positive integer $0 \\leq T \\leq 20$ indicating the number of cases.<br>Next T lines: each line has a positive integer $n \\leq 10^5$, a positive real $0.1 \\leq p \\leq 0.9$, and a positive integer $x \\leq 100$.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case: output &apos;&apos;Case #k: ans&apos;&apos; (without quotes), where $k$ is the number of the test cases, and $ans$ is the expectation of keys of the optimal strategy.<br>Your answer is considered correct if and only if the absolute error or the relative error is smaller than $10^{-6}$. <br>","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n1 0.5 2\n2 0.4 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 4.000000\nCase #2: 6.444444</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=The+2015+ACM-ICPC+China+Shanghai+Metropolitan+Programming+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> The 2015 ACM-ICPC China Shanghai Metropolitan Programming Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
