For each integer i (1 &lt;= i &lt;= n), she asks the students to write down the number of integers greater than i that appears before i in the given permutation. This number is denoted ai. For example, if n = 8 and the permutation is 2,7,3,5,4,1,8,6, then a1 = 5 because there are 5 numbers (2, 7, 3, 5, 4) greater than 1 appearing before it. Similarly, a4 = 2 because there are 2 numbers (7, 5) greater than 4 appearing before it. <br><br>John, one of the students in the class, is studying for the final exams now. He found out that he has lost the assignment questions. He only has the answers (the ai&apos;s) but not the original permutation. Can you help him determine the original permutation, so he can review how to obtain the answers? <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of a number of test cases.
