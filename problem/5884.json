Now, Bob receives a task from Alice.<br>Alice will give Bob $N$ sorted sequences, and the $i$-th sequence includes $a_i$ elements. Bob need to merge all of these sequences. He can write a program, which can merge no more than $k$ sequences in one time. The cost of a merging operation is the sum of the length of these sequences. Unfortunately, Alice allows this program to use no more than $T$ cost. So Bob wants to know the smallest $k$ to make the program complete in time.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains an integer $t_0$, the number of test cases. $t_0$ test cases follow.<br>For each test case, the first line consists two integers $N~(2 \\leq N \\leq 100000)$ and $T~(\\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_i &lt; T &lt; 2^{31}<br>)$.<br>In the next line there are $N$ integers $a_1, a_2, a_3, ... , a_N(\\forall i, 0 \\leq a_i \\leq 1000)$.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test cases, output the smallest $k$.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n5 25\n1 2 3 4 5</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2016+ACM%2FICPC+Asia+Regional+Qingdao+Online&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2016 ACM/ICPC Asia Regional Qingdao Online </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
