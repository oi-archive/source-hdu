Little Q likes sport walking very much, he plans to walk for $q$ days. On the $i$-th day, Little Q plans to start walking at the $s_i$-th intersection, walk through at least $k_i$ streets and finally return to the $t_i$-th intersection.<br>Little Q&apos;s smart phone will record his walking route. Compared to stay healthy, Little Q cares the statistics more. So he wants to minimize the total walking length of each day.
