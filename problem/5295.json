In a normal day, he found a bright screen. There were 4 points labeled by &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;A&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; , &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;B&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; , &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;C&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; , &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;D&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, and rasen could drag these point. And two points &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;E&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; , &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;F&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; moved. Rasen found that &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;E&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; is the middle point of &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;A&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; and &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;B&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, and &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;F&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; is the middle point of &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;C&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; and &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;D&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;. Near the screen there was a marble slab.There were a list of the distance of AB , BC , CD , DA and EF. Rasen also found that the distance of these edge of the points in screen showed at the same time he drop the points. He wanted to know what will happen if the distances in screen are same with the number in slab.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The first line of input contains only one integer T(&lt;=50000), the number of test cases. <br>   Each case contains five float number, indicating the distance of AB , BC , CD , DA , EF.&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;0&lt;=distance&lt;=10000&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"   For each test, first print a line &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Case #i:&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;(without quotes),with i implying the case number, then output the coordinates of A,B,C,D four points.
