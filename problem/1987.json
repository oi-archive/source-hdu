They first agree secretly on two numbers that will be used as the number of rows (R) and columns (C) in a matrix. The sender encodes an intermediate format using the following rules:<br>1. The text is formed with uppercase letters [A-Z] and &lt;space&gt;.<br>2. Each text character will be represented by decimal values as follows:<br>&lt;space&gt; = 0, A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Y = 25, Z = 26<br>The sender enters the 5 digit binary representation of the characters&#x2019; values in a spiral pattern along the matrix as shown below. The matrix is padded out with zeroes (0) to fill the matrix completely. For example, if the text to encode is: &quot;ACM&quot; and R=4 and C=4, the matrix would be filled in as follows:<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C105-1004-1.JPG\"> </center><br><br>The bits in the matrix are then concatenated together in row major order and sent to the receiver.<br>The example above would be encoded as: 0000110100101100<br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a single integer N, (1 &#x2264; N &#x2264; 1000) which is the number of datasets that follow.<br>Each dataset consists of a single line of input containing R (1&lt;=R&lt;=20), a space, C (1&lt;=C&lt;=20), a space, and a string of binary digits that represents the contents of the matrix (R * C binary digits).<br>The binary digits are in row major order.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each dataset, you should generate one line of output with the following values: The dataset number as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a space, and the decoded text message.
