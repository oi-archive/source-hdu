In every position of this maze, there is either a $0$ or a $1$ written on it.<br><br>An explorer gets lost in this grid. His position now is $(1, 1)$, and he wants to go to the exit. Since to arrive at the exit is easy for him, he wants to do something more difficult. At first, he&apos;ll write down the number on position $(1, 1)$. Every time, he could make a move to one adjacent position (two positions are adjacent if and only if they share an edge). While walking, he will write down the number on the position he&apos;s on to the end of his number. When finished, he will get a binary number. Please determine the minimum value of this number in binary system.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input is a single integer $T\\ (T=10)$, indicating the number of testcases. <br><br>For each testcase, the first line contains two integers $n$ and $m \\ (1 \\le n, m \\le 1000)$.
