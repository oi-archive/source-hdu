There are several chesses on the chessboard. They can move one chess in one turn. If there are no other chesses on the right adjacent block of the moved chess, move the chess to its right adjacent block. Otherwise, skip over these chesses and move to the right adjacent block of them. Two chesses can&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t be placed at one block and no chess can be placed out of the chessboard. When someone can&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t move any chess during his/her turn, he/she will lose the game. Alice always take the first turn. Both Alice and Bob will play the game with the best strategy. Alice wants to know if she can win the game.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Multiple test cases.<br><br>The first line contains an integer $T (T \\leq 100)$, indicates the number of test cases.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains a single integer $n (n \\leq 1000)$, the number of lines of chessboard.<br><br>Then $n$ lines, the first integer of ith line is $m (m \\leq 20)$, indicates the number of chesses on the ith line of the chessboard.
