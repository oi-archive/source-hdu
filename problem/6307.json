Each time she can go left or right (i.e. if Chiaki is at $x$, then she can go to $x-1$ or $x+1$) and then press the switch of the light in that position (i.e. if the light is turned on before, it will be turned off and vise versa).<br>For each $p=1,2,\\dots,n$, Chiaki would like to know the minimum steps needed to turn off all the lights.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
