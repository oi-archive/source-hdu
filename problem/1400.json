One night, after producing the drawings in his &apos;toilet series&apos; (where he had to use his toilet paper to draw on, for all of his paper was filled with squares and rectangles), he dreamt of filling a large rectangle with small rectangles of width 2 and height 1 in varying ways. <br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1400-1.gif\"></center><br><br>Expert as he was in this material, he saw at a glance that he&apos;ll need a computer to calculate the number of ways to fill the large rectangle whose dimensions were integer values, as well. Help him, so that his dream won&apos;t turn into a nightmare! <br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1400-2.gif\"></center><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file contains several test cases.
