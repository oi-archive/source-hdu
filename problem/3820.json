In each cell you can choose to put a golden or silver egg in it, or just leave it empty. If you put an egg in the cell, you will get some points which depends on the color of the egg. But for every pair of adjacent eggs with the same color, you lose G points if there are golden and lose S points otherwise. Two eggs are adjacent if and only if there are in the two cells which share an edge. Try to make your points as high as possible.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer T indicating the number of test cases.<br>There are four integers N, M, G and S in the first line of each test case.
