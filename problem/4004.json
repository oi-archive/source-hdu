The  most  famous  game  is  the  Ironfrog Triathlon. One test in the Ironfrog Triathlon is jumping. This project requires the frog athletes to jump  over  the  river.  The  width  of  the  river  is  L  (1&lt;=  L  &lt;=  1000000000).  There  are  n  (0&lt;=  n  &lt;= 500000) stones lined up in a straight line from one side to the other side of the river. The frogs can only jump through the river, but they can land on the stones. If they fall into the river, they <br>are out. The frogs was asked to jump at most m (1&lt;=  m &lt;= n+1) times. Now the frogs want to know  if  they  want  to  jump  across  the  river,  at  least  what  ability  should  they  have.  (That  is  the frog&apos;s longest jump distance).
