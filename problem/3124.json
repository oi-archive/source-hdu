We always believe UFO is the vehicle of aliens. But there is an interrogation about why UFO always likes a circular saucer? There must be a reason. Actually our scientists are developing a new traffic system &#x201C;Moonmist&#x201D;. It is distinguished from the traditional traffic. We use circular saucers in this new traffic system and the saucers moves extremely fast. When our scientists did their test, they found that traffic accident was too hard to be avoided because of the high speed of the advanced saucer. They need us to develop a system that can tell them the nearest saucer. The distance between two saucers is defined as the shortest distance between any two points in different saucers.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line consists of an integer T, indicating the number of test cases.<br>The first line of each case consists of an integer N, indicating the number of saucers.
