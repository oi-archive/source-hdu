If we want to calculate the value that 3 plus 9, we just import 3 and 9.after calculation of computer, we will get the result of 12.<br>But after learning &lt;&lt;The Principle Of Computer&gt;&gt;,we know that the computer will do the calculation as the following steps:<br>1 computer change the 3 into binary formality like 11;<br>2 computer change the 9 into binary formality like 1001;<br>3 computer plus the two number and get the result 1100;<br>4 computer change the result into decimal formality like 12;<br>5 computer export the result;<br><br>In the computer system there are other formalities to deal with the number such as hexadecimal. Now I will give several number with a kind of change method, for example, if I give you 1011(2), it means 1011 is a number in the binary system, and 123(10) means 123 if a number in the decimal system. Now I will give you some numbers with any kind of system, you guys should tell me the sum of the number in the decimal system.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There will be several cases. The first line of each case contains one integers N, and N means there will be N numbers to import, then there will be N numbers at the next N lines, each line contains a number with such form : X1&#x2026;.Xn.(Y), and 0&lt;=Xi&lt;Y, 1&lt;Y&lt;=10. I promise you that the sum will not exceed the 100000000, and there will be at most 100 cases and the 0&lt;N&lt;=1000.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"There is only one line output case for each input case, which is the sum of all the number.
