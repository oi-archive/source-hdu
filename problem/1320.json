If i &lt; j and Ai &gt; Aj then the pair (Ai,Aj) is called an &quot;inversion&quot; of the permutation. For example, the permutation {3, 1, 4, 2} has three inversions: (3,1), (3,2) and (4,2).<br>  The inversion table B1,B2,...,Bn of the permutation { A1,A2,...,An } is obtained by letting Bj be the number of elements to the left of j that are greater than j. (In other words, Bj is the number of inversions whose second component is j.) For example, the permutation:<br>{ 5,9,1,8,2,6,4,7,3 }<br>has the inversion table<br>2 3 6 4 0 2 2 1 0<br>since there are 2 numbers, 5 and 9, to the left of 1; 3 numbers, 5, 9 and 8, to the left of 2; etc.<br>  Perhaps the most important fact about inversions is Marshall Hall&apos;s observation that an inversion table uniquely determines the corresponding permutation. So your task is to convert a permutation to its inversion table, or vise versa, to convert from an inversion table to the corresponding permutation.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases.
