In order to make room for student activities, to make the university a more pleasant place for learning, and to beautify the campus, the college administrator decided to start construction on an open space.<br>The designers measured the open space and come to a conclusion that the open space is a rectangle with a length of n meters and a width of m meters. Then they split the open space into n x m squares. To make it more beautiful, the designer decides to cover the open space with 1 x 1 bricks and 1 x 2 bricks, according to the following rules:<br><br>1. All the bricks can be placed horizontally or vertically<br>2. The vertexes of the bricks should be placed on integer lattice points<br>3. The number of 1 x 1 bricks shouldn&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t be less than C or more than D. The number of 1 x 2 bricks is unlimited.<br>4. Some squares have a flowerbed on it, so it should not be covered by any brick. (We use 0 to represent a square with flowerbet and 1 to represent other squares)<br><br>Now the designers want to know how many ways are there to cover the open space, meeting the above requirements.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases, please process till EOF.<br>Each test case starts with a line containing four integers N(1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100), M(1 &lt;= M &lt;= 10), C, D(1 &lt;= C &lt;= D &lt;= 20). Then following N lines, each being a string with the length of M. The string consists of &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;0&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; and &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; only, where &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;0&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; means the square should not be covered by any brick, and &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; otherwise.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Please print one line per test case.
