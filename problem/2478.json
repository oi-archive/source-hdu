Each of them is transparent and formed as a rectangle. In a traditional problem, one may have to calculate the intersecting area of these N slides. The definition of intersection area is such area which belongs to all of the slides.<br>But this time I want to take out some one of the N slides, so that the intersecting area of the left N-1 slides should be maximal. Tell me the maximum answer.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases, followed by the input data for each test case. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100000), the number of rectangles. Followed by N lines, each line contains four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 (-10000 &lt;= x1 &lt; x2 &lt;= 10000, -10000 &lt;= y1 &lt; y2 &lt;= 10000), pair (x1, y1) gives out the bottom-left corner and pair (x2, y2) gives out the top-right corner of the rectangle.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"There should be one line per test case containing the maximum intersecting area of corresponding N-1 slides.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n2\n0 0 2 2\n1 1 2 2\n3\n0 0 2 2\n1 0 3 2\n1 1 3 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4\n2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2008+Asia+Regional+Chengdu&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2008 Asia Regional Chengdu </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
