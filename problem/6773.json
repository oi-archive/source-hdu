There are $n$ dishes of meat in the boiling water, labeled by $1,2,\\dots,n$. The $i$-th dish of meat will be OK to eat at time $a_i$, and it will take Little Q $b_i$ units of time to swallow it. It is impossible for Little Q to swallow more than one dish of meat at the same moment. Note that for the $i$-th dish of meat, Little Q can choose to ignore it for a while and swallow it later.<br><br>Little Q is called &quot;King of Hot Pot&quot;, and he wants to show off before Tangjz by swallowing $k$ dishes of meat as soon as possible. Please write a program to help Little Q find $k$ dishes of meat and the order to swallow them such that the time he spends on reaching the target is minimized for every possible value of $k$ ($1\\leq k\\leq n$). Note that the time for waiting is also included in the answer.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \\leq T \\leq 10\\,000$), the number of test cases.<br><br>For each case, the first line of the input contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 300\\,000$), denoting the number of dishes of meat.<br><br>Each of the following $n$ lines contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1\\leq a_i,b_i\\leq <br>10^9$), denoting each dish of meat.<br><br>It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ is at most $1\\,000\\,000$.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output a single line containing $n$ integers, the $k$-th ($1\\leq k\\leq n$) of which denoting the minimum possible units of time needed for Little Q to swallow $k$ dishes of meat.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n5\n1 2\n4 6\n3 5\n4 2\n3 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3 5 7 12 18</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2020+Multi-University+Training+Contest+2&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2020 Multi-University Training Contest 2 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
