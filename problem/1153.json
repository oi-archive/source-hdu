In order to see the magic in the string let us append a non-bit x to it, regard the new thingy as a cyclic string, and make this square matrix of bits <br><br>each bit   1001   <br>every 2nd bit   0110   <br>every 3rd bit   0110   <br>every 4th bit   1001   <br><br>This matrix has the same number of rows as the length of the original bitstring. The m-th row of the matrix has every m-th bit of the original string starting with the m-th bit. Because the enlarged thingy has prime length, the appended x never gets used. <br><br>If each row of the matrix is either the original bitstring or its complement, the original bitstring is magic. <br><br>Each line of input (except last) contains a prime number p &#x2264; 100000. The last line contains 0 and this line should not be processed. For each prime number from the input produce one line of output containing the lexicographically smallest, non-constant magic bitstring of length p-1, if such a string exists, otherwise output Impossible. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5\n3\n17\n47\n2\n79\n0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">0110\n01\n0010111001110100\n0000100001101010001101100100111010100111101111\nImpossible\n001001100001011010000001001111001110101010100011000011011111101001011110011011</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=University+of+Waterloo+Local+Contest+2005.06.11&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> University of Waterloo Local Contest 2005.06.11 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
