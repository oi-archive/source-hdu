The software supports drawing several rectangles and filling some of them with a color different from the color of the background. You are to implement an important function. The function answer such queries as what is the colored area if a subset of rectangles on the screen are filled.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing two integers N(1 &#x2264; N &#x2264; 20) and M(1 &#x2264; M &#x2264; 100000), indicating the number of rectangles on the screen and the number of queries, respectively.<br>The i-th line of the following N lines contains four integers X1,Y1,X2,Y2 (0 &#x2264; X1 &lt; X2 &#x2264; 1000, 0 &#x2264; Y1 &lt; Y2 &#x2264; 1000), which indicate that the lower-left and upper-right coordinates of the i-th rectangle are (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2). Rectangles are numbered from 1 to N.<br>The last M lines of each test case describe M queries. Each query starts with a integer R(1&lt;=R &#x2264; N), which is the number of rectangles the query is supposed to fill. The following list of R integers in the same line gives the rectangles the query is supposed to fill, each integer of which will be between 1 and N, inclusive.<br><br>The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeros.
