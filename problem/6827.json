So few students are working in the studio in the 3rd Building. Students are even more reluctant to go to the 3rd Building for experiments, which are also annoying.<br><br>Kanade takes responsibility to improve this status. She thinks it a good idea to decorate the ginkgo trees along the road to the 3rd Building, making them cute. There are $n$ ginkgo trees that are planted along the road, numbered with $1\\ldots n$. Each tree has a cute value. The cute value of tree $i$ is $s_i$.<br><br>Kanade defines a <b> plan </b> as an ordered pair $(i,j)$, here $1\\le i\\le j\\le n$. It means a student will appear at the position of the tree $i$ magically, walk along the road, and finally stop walking at the position of the tree $j$. The <b> cute level </b> of a plan is the average of the cute value of the trees visited. Formally, the cute level of plan $(i,j)$ is $\\frac{1}{j-i+1}\\sum_{k=i}^j s_k$.<br><br>Kanade wants to know the mathematical expectation of the cute level if a student will take a plan among all these plans in a uniformly random way. But she is busy with learning Computer Networking, would you help her?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T$ &#x2014; the number of testcases.
