Each pair of rooms is connected by one and only one path. Initially, lxhgww is in room 1. Each room has a dangerous trap. When lxhgww step into a room, he has a possibility to be killed and restart from room 1. Every room also has a hidden exit. Each time lxhgww comes to a room, he has chance to find the exit and escape from this maze.<br><br>Unfortunately, lxhgww has no idea about the structure of the whole maze. Therefore, he just chooses a tunnel randomly each time. When he is in a room, he has the same possibility to choose any tunnel connecting that room (including the tunnel he used to come to that room).<br>What is the expect number of tunnels he go through before he find the exit?<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"First line is an integer T (T &#x2264; 30), the number of test cases.<br><br>At the beginning of each case is an integer N (2 &#x2264; N &#x2264; 10000), indicates the number of rooms in this case.<br><br>Then N-1 pairs of integers X, Y (1 &#x2264; X, Y &#x2264; N, X &#x2260; Y) are given, indicate there is a tunnel between room X and room Y.<br><br>Finally, N pairs of integers Ki and Ei (0 &#x2264; Ki, Ei &#x2264; 100, Ki + Ei &#x2264; 100, K1 = E1 = 0) are given, indicate the percent of the possibility of been killed and exit in the ith room.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one line &#x201C;Case k: &#x201D;. k is the case id, then the expect number of tunnels lxhgww go through before he exit.
