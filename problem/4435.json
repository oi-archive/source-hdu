M^3 owns a palace and a car and the palace resides in city 1. One day, she wants to travel around all the cities from her palace and finally back to her home. However, her car has limited energy and can only travel by no more than D meters. Before it was run out of energy, it should be charged in some oil station. Under M^3&apos;s despotic power, the judge is forced to build several oil stations in some of the cities. The judge must build an oil station in city 1 and building other oil stations is up to his choice as long as M^3 can successfully travel around all the cities.<br>Building an oil station in city i will cost 2<sup>i-1</sup> MMMB.
