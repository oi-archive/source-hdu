Each classroom has a coordinate. Now Little Q wants to build several candy shops in these $n$ classrooms.<br><br>The total cost consists of two parts. Building a candy shop at classroom $i$ would have some cost $c_i$. For every classroom $P$ without any candy shop, then the distance between $P$ and the rightmost classroom with a candy shop on $P$&apos;s left side would be included in the cost too. Obviously, if there is a classroom without any candy shop, there must be a candy shop on its left side.<br><br>Now Little Q wants to know how to build the candy shops with the minimal cost.
