Because queuing is so boring, that they want to play a game to kill the time. The game is called &#x201C;Queue-jumpers&#x201D;. Suppose that there are N people numbered from 1 to N stand in a line initially. Each time you should simulate one of the following operations:<br>1.&#xA0;&#xA0;Top x :Take person x to the front of the queue<br>2.&#xA0;&#xA0;Query x: calculate the current position of person x<br>3.&#xA0;&#xA0;Rank x: calculate the current person at position x<br>Where x is in [1, N].<br>Ponyo is so clever that she plays the game very well while Garfield has no idea. Garfield is now turning to you for help.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"In the first line there is an integer T, indicates the number of test cases.(T&lt;=50)<br>In each case, the first line contains two integers N(1&lt;=N&lt;=10^8), Q(1&lt;=Q&lt;=10^5).
