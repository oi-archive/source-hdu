Permanent horizon, and my heart will never change &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<br> <br>We say that integer x, 0 &lt; x &lt; n,(n is a odd prime number) is a LovePoint-based-on n if and only if the set { (x<sup>i</sup> mod n) | 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n-1 } is equal to { 1, ..., n-1 }. For example, the powers of 3 modulo 7 are 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, and thus 3 is a LovePoint-based-on 7. <br>Now give you a integer n &gt;= 3(n will not exceed 2<sup>31</sup>).<br>We say the number of LovePoint-based-on n is the number of days the earth rotating.<br>Your task is to calculate the number of days someone loved you.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Each line of the input contains an integer n.
