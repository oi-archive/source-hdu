N villages numbered from 0 to N - 1 are located along the lake and a loop-line bus is the only transportation in this town. The bus is a one-way line passing the villages 0, 1, 2, ... , N - 1 successively, going back to the 0-th village and continuing the above route.<br>We may measure the landscape of the i-th villages by an integer $w_i$ and $\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}$ $w_i$ = 0. Once a traveller takes the bus from the u-th village to the v-th village, he would evaluate the experience by two coefficients a = $w_v$ and b the sum of w(s) which $b = w_0 + w_1 + ... + w_v$. The data is guaranteed that the sum $b \\ge 0$. Now, as the tour guide, you need to design a travel brochure for guests who came from far away. Your task is to choose a village $i_0$ as the starting village of the travel and at least two more villages $i_1, i_2, ... , i_k$. Guests would<br>start their travel from the $i_0$-th village and visit the planned k villages in sequence by loop-line bus. Finally they will go back to the $i_0$-th village from the $i_k$-th one and finish their travel. If we let $i_{k+1} = i_0$, the whole travel would be evaluated by the score $\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=0}^{k}(a_{i_{j+1}} - a_{i_j})\\frac{b_{i_{j}}b_{i_{j+1}}}{a_{i_{j}}a_{i_{j+1}}}$. The negative contribution to the score are requested to be the summation of a contiguous piece. You need to know the maximum possible score.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains an integer t which is the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow. For each test case, the first line consists of an integer N (3 &#x2264; N &#x2264; 100000). The second line consists of N non-zero integers<br>$w_0$ to $w_{N-1}$ where each $w_i$ satisfies $|w_i|$ &#x2264; 100. We guarantee that the sum of $w_i$ would be zero.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each case, output the maximum score of the whole evaluation rounded to 5 decimal places behind the decimal point in a line.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n10\n1 4 1 2 -3 -5 2 -2 2 -2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">28.66667\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nThe best route starts from the 5-th village.
