The term has become increasing popular since the advent of cheap and reliable computers. Many companies now employ a single coder to write an algorithm that will replace many other employees. An added benefit to the employer is that the coder will also become redundant once their work is done.  <sup>1</sup><br>&#x3000;&#x3000;You are now the signle coder, and have been assigned a new task writing code, since your boss would like to replace many other employees (and you when you become redundant once your task is complete).<br>Your code should be able to complete a task to replace these employees who do nothing all day but eating: make the digest sum.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;By saying &#x201C;digest sum&#x201D; we study some properties of data. For the sake of simplicity, our data is a set of integers. Your code should give response to following operations:<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;1. add x &#x2013; add the element x to the set;<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;2. del x &#x2013; remove the element x from the set;<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;3. sum &#x2013; find the digest sum of the set.
