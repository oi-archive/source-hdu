Every node i has its own weight W<sub>v</sub>, and every edge e has its own weight W<sub>e</sub>.<br><br>They take turns to do the following operations. During each operation, either Alice or Bob can take one of the nodes from the graph that haven&apos;t been taken before. Alice goes first.<br><br>The scoring rule is: One person can get the bonus attached to a node if he/she have choosen that node before. One person can get the bonus attached to a edge if he/she have choosen both node that induced by the edge before.<br><br>You can assume Alice and Bob are intelligent enough and do operations optimally, both Alice and Bob&apos;s target is maximize their score - opponent&apos;s.<br><br>What is the final result for Alice - Bob.<br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Muilticases.
