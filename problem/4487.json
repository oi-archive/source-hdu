Your expected position after a period of time is zero; that is, the average over many such random walks is that you end up where you started. A more interesting   question is what is the expected rightmost position you will  attain during the walk.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a single integer P, (1  &lt;=  P &lt;= 15), which is the number of data sets that follow.  Each data set should be processed identically and independently.<br><br>Each data set consists of a single line of input consisting of four space-separated values.  The first value is an integer K, which is the data set number.  Next is an integer n, which is the number of steps to take (1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100).  The final two are double precision floating-point values L and R<br>which are the probabilities of taking a step left or right respectively at each step (0 &lt;= L &lt;= 1,  0  &lt;= R &lt;= 1,  0  &lt;=  L+R   &lt;=  1).
