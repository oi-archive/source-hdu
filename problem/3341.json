They always play &quot;number game&quot;(A boring game based on number theory) together. We all know that AekdyCoin is the man called &quot;nuclear weapon of FZU,descendant of Jingrun&quot;, because of his talent in the field of number theory. So Lost had never won the game. He was so ashamed and angry, but he didn&apos;t know how to improve his level of number theory.<br><br>One noon, when Lost was lying on the bed, the Spring Brother poster on the wall(Lost is a believer of Spring Brother) said hello to him! Spring Brother said, &quot;I&apos;m Spring Brother, and I saw AekdyCoin shames you again and again. I can&apos;t bear my believers were being bullied. Now, I give you a chance to rearrange your gene sequences to defeat AekdyCoin!&quot;.<br><br>It&apos;s soooo crazy and unbelievable to rearrange the gene sequences, but Lost has no choice. He knows some genes called &quot;number theory gene&quot; will affect one &quot;level of number theory&quot;. And two of the same kind of gene in different position in the gene sequences will affect two &quot;level of number theory&quot;, even though they overlap each other. There is nothing but revenge in his mind. So he needs you help to calculate the most &quot;level of number theory&quot; after rearrangement.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are less than 30 testcases.<br>For each testcase, first line is number of &quot;number theory gene&quot; N(1&lt;=N&lt;=50).
