The rule of the game is described below: <br><br>   &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; In the beginning of the game, there are a lot of piles of beads.<br><br>   &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; Players take turns to play. Each turn, player choose a pile i and remove some (at least one) beads from it. Then he could do nothing or split pile i into two piles with a beads and b beads.(a,b &gt; 0 and a + b equals to the number of beads of pile i after removing) <br><br>   &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; If after a player&apos;s turn, there is no beads left, the player is the winner.<br><br>   Suppose that the two players are all very clever and they will use optimal game strategies.
