A string is D-unique if all of its D-pairs are different. A string is surprising if it is D-unique for every possible distance D.<br><br>Consider the string ZGBG. Its 0-pairs are ZG, GB, and BG. Since these three pairs are all different, ZGBG is 0-unique. Similarly, the 1-pairs of ZGBG are ZB and GG, and since these two pairs are different, ZGBG is 1-unique. Finally, the only 2-pair of ZGBG is ZG, so ZGBG is 2-unique. Thus ZGBG is surprising. (Note that the fact that ZG is both a 0-pair and a 2-pair of ZGBG is irrelevant, because 0 and 2 are different distances.)<br><br>Acknowledgement: This problem is inspired by the &quot;Puzzling Adventures&quot; column in the December 2003 issue of Scientific American.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of one or more nonempty strings of at most 79 uppercase letters, each string on a line by itself, followed by a line containing only an asterisk that signals the end of the input.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each string of letters, output whether or not it is surprising using the exact output format shown below.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">ZGBG\nX\nEE\nAAB\nAABA\nAABB\nBCBABCC\n*</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">ZGBG is surprising.\nX is surprising.\nEE is surprising.\nAAB is surprising.\nAABA is surprising.\nAABB is NOT surprising.\nBCBABCC is NOT surprising.</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=Mid-Central+USA+2006&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> Mid-Central USA 2006 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
