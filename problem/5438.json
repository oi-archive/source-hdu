Each pond has a value $v$.<br><br>Now Betty wants to remove some ponds because she does not have enough money. But each time when she removes a pond, she can only remove the ponds which are connected with less than two ponds, or the pond will explode.<br><br>Note that Betty should keep removing ponds until no more ponds can be removed.
