You need to have these employees work together to wax the floor of some rooms, each with 1 door.<br><br>None of the workers want to work more than the others, and insist on working together so they can see if someone else is goofing off, so you must assign equal areas of each room to each employee. Each worker is assigned a contiguous portion of the room to wax. The portions assigned are separated by straight line segments that radiate out from the doorway to a wall in the room, so they can exit the room after the job is done.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input is a series of problem definitions as follows:<br><br>WIDTH HEIGHT DOOR WORKERS<br><br>Each is a non-negative integer value less than or equal to 100, with at least 2 workers, and a positive WIDTH and HEIGHT.
