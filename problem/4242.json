As shown in the figure, Al&apos;s tract is to be bounded by the line from A to B, the line from A to the midpoint of BC and the line from B to the midpoint of CD&apos; Bob&amp;s  ract is to be bounded by the line from B to C, the line from B to the midpoint of CD and the line from C to the midpoint of DA, and so on. <br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C397-1007-1.jpg\"></center><br>Your job is to write a program that will help Rancher Joel determine the area of each child&apos;s tract and the length of the fence he will have to put around Emily&apos;s parcel to keep her brothers&apos; cows out of her crops.   <br> <br>For his problem, A will always be at (0, 0) and B will always be at (x, 0). Coordinates will be in rods (a rod is 16.5 feet).The returned areas should be in acres to 3 decimal places (an acre is 160 square rods) and the length of the fence should be in feet, rounded up to the next foot.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a single integer P( 1 &lt;= P &lt;= 1000),which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set is a single line that contains of a decimal integer followed by five (5) space separated floating-point values. The first (integer) value is the data set number, N. The floating-point values are B.x, C.x, C.y, D.x and D.y in that order (where V.x indicates the x coordinate of V and V.y indicates the y coordinate of V).
