In each game, contestants are given a card with four positive integers <i>i<sub>1</sub>, i<sub>2</sub>, i<sub>3</sub>, i<sub>4</sub></i> on it, and the first one who can use all of these numbers and any combination of the four basic arithmetic operations to get 24 wins. Each of the numbers <i>i<sub>1</sub>, i<sub>2</sub>, i<sub>3</sub>, i<sub>4</sub></i> must be used exactly once. Division can be used only if the divisor evenly divides the dividend (i.e., you can perform 6/2 but not 6/4). For example, if the card contains the numbers 7, 2, 5 and 1, possible solutions are (7-2)*5-1 or (7+1)*(5-2). Hmmm . . . this sounds like a source of a good programming problem.<br><br>Write a program that determines the longest consecutive sequence of integers that can be obtained by different ways of arithmetically combining the four integers. For example, with 7, 2, 5 and 1 the longest consecutive sequence is -18 to 26 (yes, we&apos;re allowing final results to be negative). The &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; operators must be used as binary operators, not as unary signs.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Each test case will consist of a single line containing the four, not necessarily distinct, positive integers, none of which will exceed 100.
