In order to simplify the problem, we will regard the wall as a set of r*c small squares. The area of one small square is 1 and a small square could be expressed as (x , y) (1&lt;=x&lt;=r, 1&lt;=y&lt;=c). <br>So every time when we are painting some selected area, we are covering the small squares in that area with a particular color.<br>Your task is to calculate the number of colors which are completely covered after m times of painting.<br>For example, given a rectangular area of a upper left corner (x1, y1) and a lower right corner (x2, y2)<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Multiple test cases, end with EOF.<br>In every test case:<br>   In the first line, there will be 3 integers: r c m. r and c are the length and width of the wall , and m is the number of colors of the oil paint.
