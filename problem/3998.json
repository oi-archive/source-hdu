We define increasing subsequence of X <br>as x[i1], x[i2],...,x[ik], which satisfies follow conditions:<br>1) x[i1] &lt; x[i2],...,&lt;x[ik];<br>2) 1&lt;=i1 &lt; i2,...,&lt;ik&lt;=n<br><br>As an excellent program designer, you must know how to find the maximum length of the <br>increasing sequense, which is defined as s. Now, the next question is how many increasing <br>subsequence with s-length can you find out from the sequence X.<br><br>For example, in one case, if s = 3, and you can find out 2 such subsequence A and B from X.<br>1) A = a1, a2, a3. B = b1, b2, b3.<br>2) <font color=\"red\">Each ai or bj(i,j = 1,2,3) can only be chose once at most.</font><br><br>Now, the question is:<br>1) Find the maximum length of increasing subsequence of X(i.e. s).<br>2) Find the number of increasing subsequence with s-length under conditions described (i.e. num).","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file have many cases.
