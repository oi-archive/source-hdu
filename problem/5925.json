One day, TanBig dreams of a field of coconuts, and the field looks like a large chessboard which has R rows and C columns. In every cell of the field, there is one coconut. Unfortunately, some of the coconuts have gone bad. For sake of his health, TanBig will eat the coconuts following the rule that he can only eat good coconuts and can only eat a connected component of good coconuts one time(you can consider the bad coconuts as barriers, and the good coconuts are 4-connected, which means one coconut in cell (x, y) is connected to (x - 1, y), (x + 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x, y - 1).<br><br>Now TanBig wants to know how many times he needs to eat all the good coconuts in the field, and how many coconuts he would eat each time(the area of each 4-connected component).<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains apositiveinteger T($T \\leq 10$) which denotes the test cases.
