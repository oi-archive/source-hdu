He numbers the balls from 0 to N-1, and numbers the boxes from 0 to A-1. To find the balls easily, he puts the ball numbered x into the box numbered a if x = a mod A.<br>Some day Bob buys B new boxes, and he wants to rearrange the balls from the old boxes to the new boxes. The new boxes are numbered from 0 to B-1. After the rearrangement, the ball numbered x should be in the box number b if x = b mod B.<br>This work may be very boring, so he wants to know the cost before the rearrangement. If he moves a ball from the old box numbered a to the new box numbered b, the cost he considered would be |a-b|. The total cost is the sum of the cost to move every ball, and it is what Bob is interested in now.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input is an integer T, the number of test cases.(0&lt;T&lt;=50)<br>Then T test case followed.
