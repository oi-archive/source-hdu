The kingdom consists of N cities, numbered from east to west. The 1-th city, which is located to the east of others, is the capital. Each city, except the capital, links none or several cities to the west, and exactly one city to the east.<br>There are some significant news happening in some cities every day. The Elder wants to know them as soon as possible. So, that is the job of journalist frogs, who run faster than any other frog. Once some tremendous news happen in a city, the journalist in that city would take the message and run to the capital. Once it reach another city, it can either continue running, or stop at that city and let another journalist to transport. The journalist frogs are too young and simple to run a long distance efficiently. As a result, it takes $L^2$ time for them to run through a path of length L. In addition, passing message requires P time for checking the message carefully, because any mistake in the message would make the Elder become extremely angry.<br>Now you are excited to receive the task to calculate the maximum time of sending a message from one of these cities to the capital.
