Each Target point moves in a straight line at a constant speed, and do not change direction. Now, consider a Chaser point that starts at the origin, and moves at a speed faster than any of the Target points. The Chaser point moves at a constant speed, but it is capable of changing direction at will. It will &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Catch&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; a Target point, and then move from there to catch another Target point, and so on.<br>Given the parameters of the Chaser point and the Target points, what is the least amount of time it takes the Chaser point to catch all of the Target points? &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Catch&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; simply means that the Catcher and the Target occupy the same point in the plane at the same time. This can be instantaneous; there&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s no need for the Catcher to stay with the Target for any non-zero length of time.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There will be several test cases in the input. Each test case will begin with two integers<br>N C<br>Where N (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 15) is the number of Target points, and C (0 &lt; C &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 1,000) is the speed of the Chaser point. Each of the next N lines will have four integers, describing a Target point:<br>X Y D S<br>Where (X,Y) is the location in the plane (-1000 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; X,Y &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 1,000) of that Target point at time 0, D (0 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; D &lt; 360) is the direction of movement in Degrees (0 degrees is the positive X axis, 90 degrees is the positive Y axis), and S (0 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; S &lt; C) is the speed of that Target point. It is assumed that all Target points start moving immediately at time 0.<br>The input will end with a line with two 0s.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output a single real number on its own line, representing the least amount of time needed for the Chaser point to catch all of the Target points. Print this number to exactly 2 decimal places, rounded.
