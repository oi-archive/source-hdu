For instance, if $p$ is $3,1,4,5,6,2$, we add the elements in the permutation to the monotonic stack one by one, the changes of the monotonic stack is as follows:<br><br>$$3 \\to 1 \\to 1,4 \\to 1,4,5 \\to 1,4,5,6 \\to 1,2$$<br><br>So the corresponding array $a$ is $1,1,2,3,4,2$.<br><br>Years later, Dodo bird found the array $a$, but the value in some positions cannot be recognized anymore.
