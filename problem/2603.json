As saying that night, Wiskey drink a lot of wine, just as he blurred, fall to sleep. All of a sudden, Wiskey felt a slight discomfort in the chest, and then vomiting, vomitted all over. The next day, Wiskey is extremely sluggish, vomit still on the train. <br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C154-1004-1.jpg\"></center><br>Your task is to calculate the coordinates of vomit. <br>We assume that the quality of vomit is m, and its size can be ignored. <br>As the figure below: <br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C154-1004-2.jpg\"> </center><br>The vomit start from the blue point A, whose speed is V, and its angle with X-axis is a.
