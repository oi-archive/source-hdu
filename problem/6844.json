The cart use nuclear power. It take $1$ point power to pass one road. Koishi has $q$ wandering plan, in the $i$-th plan Koishi wants to wander from $x_i$ to $y_i$, and the cart has $p_i$ points of power initially.<br><br>Obviously, in some plans, Koishi can&apos;t arrive the destination. To avoid this, Koishi asks Utsuho to set some nuclear-power filling station. There are $m$ such stations. The $i$-th of them is located in the node $c_i$ and the level of this station is $d_i$. When Koishi arrive node $c_i$, she can add $(d_i-s)$ points of power to her cart or do nothing. Here $s$ represents the amount of power the cart has currently. <br><br>For each plan, Koishi wants to know whether this plan can be finished successfully. Notice that she can pass the same road many times.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains of a positive integer $T(1\\leq T\\leq 500)$, representing $T$ test cases.<br><br>in each test case, the first line contains three positive integers $n,m,q(1\\leq n,m,q\\leq 10^5)$,representing the number of nodes, power stations and plans.<br><br>Each of the following $n-1$ lines contains two positive integers $u_i,v_i$, representing a road between $u_i$ and $v_i$.
