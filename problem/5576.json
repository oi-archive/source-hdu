Now he wants to do some exercise.<br><br>He wrote a string on the paper, which only contains digits and a single $\\times$ as the operator. If the $\\times$ appears at the front or the end of the string, he regards the result as <b>zero</b>, otherwise he does the calculation as $a\\ normal\\ multiplication$.<br><br>After some play, he wonders a new problem: for a initial string, each time he randomly choose two characters and swap their positions. He will do this again and again, say for $K$ times, he wants to know the expected calculation result for the newest string that he gets.<br><br>It can be shown that their can be $\\binom{n}{2} ^ K$ ways(Same as $\\left(C_{n}^{2}\\right)^K$) for the whole swap operations, so if the expected result is x, you need to output $x \\times \\binom{n}{2} ^ K$ as an integer.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"First line contains an integer $T$, which indicates the number of test cases.<br><br>Every test case begins with an integers $K$, which is the numbers of times the Frog can swap characters.<br><br>The second line of each test case contains the string Frog plays with, which only contains digits and <b>exactly one</b> multiplication operator, written as &apos;$*$&apos;.<br><br>$\\cdot$ $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$.<br><br>$\\cdot$ the string&apos;s length is $L$.<br><br>$\\cdot$ for 70% data, $1 \\leq L \\leq 10$ and $0 \\leq K \\leq 5$.<br><br>$\\cdot$ for 95% data, $1 \\leq L \\leq 20$ and $0 \\leq K \\leq 20$. <br><br>$\\cdot$ for 100% data, $1 \\leq L \\leq 50$ and $0 \\leq K \\leq 50$.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For every test case, you should output &quot;<b>Case #x: y</b>&quot;, where $x$ indicates the case number and counts from $1$ and $y$ is the result.<br><br>Because $y$ could be very large, just mod it with $10^9 + 7$.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n1\n1*2\n2\n1*2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 2\nCase #2: 6</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2015ACM%2FICPC%D1%C7%D6%DE%C7%F8%C9%CF%BA%A3%D5%BE-%D6%D8%CF%D6%C8%FC%A3%A8%B8%D0%D0%BB%BB%AA%B6%AB%C0%ED%B9%A4%A3%A9&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2015ACM/ICPC&#x4E9A;&#x6D32;&#x533A;&#x4E0A;&#x6D77;&#x7AD9;-&#x91CD;&#x73B0;&#x8D5B;&#xFF08;&#x611F;&#x8C22;&#x534E;&#x4E1C;&#x7406;&#x5DE5;&#xFF09; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
