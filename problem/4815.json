Are you curious about what technology is behind those fantastic demos?&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; asks the director of the Deep Lab. &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Deep learning, deep learning!&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; Little Tiger raises his hand briskly. &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Yes, clever boy, that&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s deep learning (&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x467;&#x3F0;/&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;)&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, says the director. &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;However, they are only &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;a piece of cake&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;. I won&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t tell you a top secret that our lab has invented a Deep Monkey (&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;) with more advanced technology. And that guy is as smart as human!&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<br><br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Nani ?!&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; Little Tiger doubts about that as he is the smartest kid in his kindergarten; even so, he is not as smart as human, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;how can a monkey be smarter than me? I will challenge him.&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<br><br>To verify their research achievement, the researchers of the Deep Lab are going to host an intelligence test for Little Tiger and Deep Monkey.<br><br>The test is composed of N binary choice questions. And different questions may have different scores according to their difficulties. One can get the corresponding score for a question if he chooses the correct answer; otherwise, he gets nothing. The overall score is counted as the sum of scores one gets from each question. The one with a larger overall score wins; tie happens when they get the same score.<br><br>Little Tiger assumes that Deep Monkey will choose the answer randomly as he doesn&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t believe the monkey is smart. Now, Little Tiger is wondering &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;what score should I get at least so that I will not lose in the contest with probability of at least P? &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;. As little tiger is a really smart guy, he can evaluate the answer quickly.<br><br>You, Deep Monkey, can you work it out? Show your power!&#xFFFD;","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a single integer T (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; T &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 10) indicating the number of test cases.
