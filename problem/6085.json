Yuta is worrying about this situation, so he gives Rikka some math tasks to practice. There is one of them:<br><br>There are $n$ children and $m$ kinds of candies. The $i$th child has $A_i$ dollars and the unit price of the $i$th kind of candy is $B_i$. The amount of each kind is infinity. <br><br>Each child has his favorite candy, so he will buy this kind of candies as much as possible and will not buy any candies of other kinds. For example, if this child has $10$ dollars and the unit price of his favorite candy is $4$ dollars, then he will buy two candies and go home with $2$ dollars left.<br><br>Now Yuta has $q$ queries, each of them gives a number $k$. For each query, Yuta wants to know the number of the pairs $(i,j)(1 \\leq i \\leq n,1 \\leq j \\leq m)$ which satisfies if the $i$th child&#x2019;s favorite candy is the $j$th kind, he will take $k$ dollars home.<br><br>To reduce the difficulty, Rikka just need to calculate the answer modulo $2$.<br><br>But It is still too difficult for Rikka.
