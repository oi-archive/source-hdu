Finally we&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;ll reach the $P_{i,N}$-th vertex, let&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s define the total distance of this route as $D(P_i)$ , so please calculate the sum of $D(P_i)$ for all $N!$ permutations.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are 10 test cases at most.<br>The first line of each test case contains one integer $N$ ( $1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 10^5$ ) .<br>For the next $N-1$ lines, each line contains three integer $X$, $Y$ and $L$, which means there is an edge between $X$-th vertex and $Y$-th of length $L$ ( $1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; X, Y &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N, 1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; L &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 10^9$ ) .","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print the answer module $10^9+7$ in one line.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3\n1 2 1\n1 3 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">16\n24</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2018%D6%D0%B9%FA%B4%F3%D1%A7%C9%FA%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%BE%BA%C8%FC+-+%CD%F8%C2%E7%D1%A1%B0%CE%C8%FC&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2018&#xFFFD;&#x439;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x467;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x1BE;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; - &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x461;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
