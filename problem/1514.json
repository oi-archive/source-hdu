He wants to win some candies in it - as many as possible.<br><br>There are 4 piles, each pile contains N candies. Bob is given a basket which can hold at most 5 candies. Each time, he puts a candy at the top of one pile into the basket, and if there&apos;re two candies of the same color in it ,he can take both of them outside the basket and put them into his own pocket. When the basket is full and there are no two candies of the same color, the game ends. If the game is played perfectly, the game will end with no candies left in the piles. <br><br>For example, Bob may play this game like this (N=5): <br><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1514-1.jpg\"><br><br>Note that different numbers indicate different colors, there are 20 kinds of colors numbered 1..20. <br><br>&apos;Seems so hard...&apos;Bob got very much puzzled.
