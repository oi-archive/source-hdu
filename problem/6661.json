He insists that we should always say an important thing $k$ times. He also believes that every string that can be obtained by concatenating $k$ copies of some nonempty string is splendid. So, he always teaches newcomers, ``String theory problems are important! String theory problems are important! ... String theory problems are important!&quot;<br><br>Today, he wants to examine whether the newcomers remember his instruction. He presents a string consisting of lower case letters and asks them the number of splendid substrings of the presented string. No one can solve this problem, and they will be scolded for hours. Can you help them solve this problem?<br><br>Note that equal splendid substrings occurred in different positions should be counted separately.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input consists of a single integer $T$ $(1 \\leq T \\leq 10)$, denoting the number of test cases.
