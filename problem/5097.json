PageRank is a link analysis tool and it assigns a numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents, such as the World Wide Web, with the purpose of &quot;measuring&quot; its relative importance within the set. The algorithm may be applied to any collection of entities with reciprocal quotations and references. The numerical weight that it assigns to any given element E is referred to as the PageRank of E and denoted by  . Other factors like Author Rank can contribute to the importance of an entity.<br><br>   For simplicity, in this problem PageRank vector q is defined as q = Gq, Where <img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C541-1008-1.jpg\">, S is the destination-by-source stochastic matrix, U is all one matrix, n is the number of nodes and &#x3B1; is the weight between 0 and 1 (here we use 0.85).<br><br>   For the example on the right, we have:<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C541-1008-2.jpg\"></center><br><br>   Denote the current PageRank vector and the next PageRank vector by q<sup>cur</sup> and q<sup>next</sup> respectively. The process is to compute the iterative powering for finding the first eigenvector.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C541-1008-3.jpg\"></center><br><br>   The computation ends until <img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C541-1008-4.jpg\"> for some small &#x3B5;(10<sup>-10</sup>).","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The input contains many test cases. <br><br>   For each case, there are multiple lines. The first line contains an integer N(N&lt;=3000), which represents the number of pages. Then a N*N zero-one matrix follows. The element E<sub>ij</sub> (0 &lt;= i, j &lt; N) on the matrix represents whether the i-th page has a hyper link to the j-th page.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"   Output one line with the eigenvector.
