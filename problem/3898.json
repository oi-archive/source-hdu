Randomly pick an element X in list T, called a pivot.<br>2. Reorder the list so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot, while all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it (equal values can go either way). After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position. This is called the partition operation.<br>3. Recursively sorts the sub-list of lesser elements and the sub-list of greater elements.<br>Here we define the cost C of sorting list T to be the sum of the following three parts:<br>1. The number of elements greater than X on X&apos;s left.<br>2. The number of elements lesser than X on X&apos;s right.<br>3. The cost of recursively sorting the sub-lists.<br>Could you please tell me what is the expected value of the cost C?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
