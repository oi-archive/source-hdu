To put it easier to analyze, your sister makes n rotations. In the i-th time, she makes everything in the plane rotate counter-clockwisely around a point ai by a radian of pi.<br><br>Now she promises that the total effect of her rotations is a single rotation around a point A by radian P (this means the sum of pi is not a multiplier of 2&#x3C0;).<br><br>Of course, you should be able to figure out what is A and P :).<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of the test cases.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains an integer n denoting the number of the rotations.
