In this game, player is expected to open some doors to win the game. There is a problem on each door, if player can give correct answer to the problem then the door will open. In a certain door, there are two integers n and k. There are some words on the door, it says: <br><br>$F\\left( n \\right) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l}<br>n{\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} if{\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} n &lt;  = 1\\\\<br>F\\left( {n - 1} \\right) + F\\left( {n - 2} \\right){\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} {\\kern 1pt} otherwise<br>\\end{array} \\right.,S\\left( n \\right) = \\sum\\limits_{i = 0}^n {DS(F(i)\\% F(k))} $ . <br><br>DS(x) means the digit sum of x. For example DS(0)=0,DS(1)=1,DS(10254)=1+0+2+5+4=12. If you can calculate S(n), the door will open, then you can advance to the next door.<br><br>In order to check play&#x2019;s answer, CodeFamer should write a program to generate the right answer. However he is busy in designing the UI, so he wants you to help him to write the program.<br><br>Here is your task, when given certain n and k, you should calculate S(n).<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
