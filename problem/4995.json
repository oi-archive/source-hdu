In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space.<br>In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of its k nearest neighbors.<br>---Wikipedia<br><br>Today, kNN takes revenge on you. You have to handle a kNN case in one-dimensional coordinate system. There are N points with a position Xi and value Vi. Then there are M kNN queries for point with index i, recalculate its value by averaging the values its k-Nearest Neighbors. Note you have to replace the value of i-th point with the new calculated value. And if there is a tie while choosing k-Nearest Neighbor, choose the one with the minimal index first.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer T, indicating the number of test cases. <br><br>Each test case begins with three integers N, M and K, in which K indicating the number of k-Nearest Neighbors.
