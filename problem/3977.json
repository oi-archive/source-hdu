Where f(0) = f(1) = 1 and for any n &gt; 1, f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2). For example, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 3, f(4) = 5 ...<br><br>The teacher used to let you calculate f(n) mod p where n &lt;= 10^18 and p &lt;= 10^9, however , as an ACMER, you may just kill it in seconds! The evil teacher is mad about this. Now he let you find the smallest integer m (m &gt; 0) such that for ANY non-negative integer n ,f(n) = f(n + m) (mod p) . For example, if p = 2, then we could find know m = 3 , f(0) = f(3) = 1(mod 2), f(1) = f(4) (mod 2) ....<br><br>Now the evil teacher will only give you one integer p( p &lt;= 2* 10^9), will you tell him the smallest m you can find ?
