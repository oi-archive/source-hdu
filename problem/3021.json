The yard is square and 1000*1000 large. The lower left corner has coordinates (0, 0), the upper right (1000, 1000). There are N trees in the yard. In order to protect them, XEN wants to fence some of them.<br><br>XEN can only select some of the M positions which are provided in advance to insert wood piles, then he built fence along the inserted wood piles. Finally, the fence will be a polygon. As the picture below (Data is in the Sample):<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/exe3021-1.JPG\"></center><br>XEN should pay 47 yuan for each wood pile which were inserted. But he can get 173 yuan from each tree which is in the final polygon.
