Yuta is worrying about this situation, so he gives Rikka some math tasks to practice. There is one of them:<br><br>Yuta has an array $A$ of length $n$&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;for each $i(1 \\leq i \\leq n)$, $A[i]$ is integer and satisfies $1 \\leq A[i] \\leq m$. Rikka wants to add some **real** numbers in $[1,m]$ to the array in order to make the average number of $A$ less than or equal to the median number of $A$.<br><br>Now, Yuta wants to minimize the number of the added numbers, and on this basis, he wants to minimize the average number of $A$.<br><br>It is too difficult for Rikka. Can you help her?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a number $T(T \\leq 1000)$&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;The number of the testcases.
