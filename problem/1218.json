Of course, all computer displays consist of a finite number of pixels, and many strategies have been devised to smooth the jagged edges with varying degrees of success.<br><br>Boudreaux and Thibodeaux are writing video game rendering software for the next big first-person shooter, and they don&apos;t know much about any of the progress made in the field of anti-aliasing. Therefore, they&apos;ve decided to use a very simplistic (and visually unappealing) method to smooth the ragged edges. Unfortunately, it blurs the entire image, but at least it gets rid of those jaggies!<br><br>Normally, the game displays in m x n pixels, but they perform an extra anti-aliasing step that converts that image into an (m - 1) x (n - 1) image. Nobody will notice a pixel missing from each dimension, and they can calculate the new pixels by averaging squares of 4 pixels from the original image (and rounding down). For example, the images below represent the original image (left) and the anti-aliased image (right) using numbers to represent varying shades of black and white.<br>4  4  4  0  <br>4  4  0  0  <br>4  0  0  0  <br>0  0  0  0  <br><br>4  3  1  <br>3  1  0  <br>1  0  0  <br> <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input to this problem will consist of a (non-empty) series of up to 100 data sets.
