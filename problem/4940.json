Each node is a city and each directed edge is a directed road. Each edge from node u to node v is associated with two values D and B, D is the cost to destroy/remove such edge, B is the cost to build an undirected edge between u and v.<br><br>   His enemy can deliver supplies from city u to city v if and only if there is a directed path from u to v. At first they can deliver supplies from any city to any other cities. So the graph is a strongly-connected graph.<br><br>   He will choose a non-empty proper subset of cities, let&#x2019;s denote this set as S. Let&#x2019;s denote the complement set of S as T. He will command his soldiers to destroy all the edges (u, v) that u belongs to set S and v belongs to set T. <br><br>   To destroy an edge, he must pay the related cost D. The total cost he will pay is X. You can use this formula to calculate X:<br>   <img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C508-1006-1.jpg\"><br>   After that, all the edges from S to T are destroyed. In order to deliver huge number of supplies from S to T, his enemy will change all the remained directed edges (u, v) that u belongs to set T and v belongs to set S into undirected edges. (Surely, those edges exist because the original graph is strongly-connected)<br><br>   To change an edge, they must remove the original directed edge at first, whose cost is D, then they have to build a new undirected edge, whose cost is B. The total cost they will pay is Y. You can use this formula to calculate Y:<br>   <img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C508-1006-2.jpg\"><br>   At last, if Y&gt;=X, Tom will achieve his goal. But Tom is so lazy that he is unwilling to take a cup of time to choose a set S to make Y&gt;=X, he hope to choose set S randomly! So he asks you if there is a set S, such that Y&lt;X. If such set exists, he will feel unhappy, because he must choose set S carefully, otherwise he will become very happy.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   There are multiply test cases.<br><br>   The first line contains an integer T(T&lt;=200), indicates the number of cases. <br><br>   For each test case, the first line has two numbers n and m. <br><br>   Next m lines describe each edge.
