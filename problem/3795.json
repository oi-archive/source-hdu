It is typically used to show the changes between a file and a former version of the same file. Diff displays the changes made per line for text files.<br>The operation of diff is based on solving the longest common subsequence problem which is as follows: Given two sequences A = a1, a2, ..., aM, and B = b1, b2, ..., bN, find the length, k, of the longest sequence C = c1, c2, ..., ck such that C is a subsequence of both A and B. As an example, if<br>A = d, y, n, a, m, i, c and B = p, r, o, g, r, a, m, m, i, n, g<br>then the longest common subsequence is a, m, i( {3,4,5} from A, {5,6,8} from B) and has length 3.<br>You may find {5,7,8} from B is also a, m, i, but {5,6,8} is lexicographic smaller, so we choose the former one. We always choose the lexicographic smallest one.<br>From the longest common subsequence it&apos;s only a small step to get diff-like output:<br>dyn-progr+m+c-ng+<br>where &apos;-&apos; means a deletion from and &apos;+&apos; means an addition to the first string.<br>Now you are supposed to simulate the diff operation.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Your program must read test cases from standard input.<br>The input file consists of several test cases. Each case contains the contents of two files. The case starts with two non-negative integers N and M (both &lt;= 50), then followed by N+M lines, each contains a string of no more than 80 characters. The first N lines are the contents of the first file, while the second M lines are of the second file.<br>The input is finished by a negative N.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, your program must output to standard output. If there is no difference found between the two files, print in a line &quot;No difference found&quot;. If there is nothing in common between the two files, print in a line &quot;Totally different&quot;. Otherwise, first print in a line the length of the longest sequence. Then for each line of the first file, print the line number, and output the differences in the diff-like format line by line, as shown by the sample output.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1 1\nThis is a test\nThis is a test\n1 1\nab\ncd\n1 1\ndynamic\nprogramming\n4 4\nThis is a test\nwhich is more complicated\nzzz\nthan ...\nThis is another test\nof the project\nwhich is much more complex\nthan the previous one\n-100</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">No difference found\nTotally different\n3\nline #1\ndyn-progr+m+c-ng+\n39\nline #1\nnother+\nline #2\nof the project+\nuch m+icat-d-\nline #3\nzzz-\nline #4\nx+\n...-the previous one+</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=%D5%E3%B4%F3%BC%C6%CB%E3%BB%FA%D1%D0%BE%BF%C9%FA%B1%A3%D1%D0%B8%B4%CA%D4%C9%CF%BB%FA%BF%BC%CA%D4-2011%C4%EA&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> &#x6D59;&#x5927;&#x8BA1;&#x7B97;&#x673A;&#x7814;&#x7A76;&#x751F;&#x4FDD;&#x7814;&#x590D;&#x8BD5;&#x4E0A;&#x673A;&#x8003;&#x8BD5;-2011&#x5E74; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
