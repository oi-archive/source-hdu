Today I invent a new game called find black hand. The game is not about catching bad people but playing on a string.<br>Now I generate a string S and several short ones s[i], and I define three kinds of operations.<br>1. Delete: remove the ith character.<br>2. Insert: in any position, insert a character if you like.<br>3. Change: change the ith character into another character if you like.<br>For each short string s[i], we define a function f(i). After several operations on S, we can find a substring of S which is the same to s[i]. And f(i) is the minimal number of operations to achieve.  It looks so native that I think every one of you can solve f(i) perfectly. So I join the string S from end to end, and f(i) changes nothing. So the string &quot;bb&quot; is also a substring of string &quot;baaab&quot;.<br>The &quot;black hand&quot; is the short string s[i] whose f(i) is minimal. Now it&apos;s your time to find the black hand. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.<br>The first line contains a non-empty string S whose length is not more than 100,000.<br>The next line contains an integer N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10) indicating the number of the short string.<br>Each of the next N lines contains a short non-empty string whose length is not more than 10.<br>All strings in the input would not have blank and all characters are lower case.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output a string first indicating the &quot;black hand&quot;, and then output an integer indicating the minimal number of the operation.
