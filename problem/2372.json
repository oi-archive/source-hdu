He is interested especially in one betting game, where a machine forms a sequence of n numbers by drawing random numbers. Each player should estimate beforehand, how many increasing subsequences of length k will exist in the sequence of numbers. <br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C144-1005-1.jpg\"></center><br><br>Bruce doesn&apos;t trust the Casino to count the number of increasing subsequences of length k correctly.

The first line of each test case contains two numbers n and k (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; k &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; n &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 100), where n is the length of the sequence drawn by the machine, and k is the desired length of the increasing subsequences. The following line contains n pairwise distinct integers a<sub>i</sub> (-10000 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; a<sub>i</sub> &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 10000 ), where a<sub>i</sub> is the i<sup>th</sup> number in the sequence drawn by the machine. <br><br>The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeros. <br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print one line with the number of increasing subsequences of length k that the input sequence contains.
