Huazheng wants to use these two simple sequences to generate a simple matrix. Here is what he decides to do:<br>Use the geometric progression as the first row of the simple matrix: $c_{0,n}=b_n$<br>Use the arithmetic progression as the first column of the simple matrix: $c_{n,0}=a_n$<br>Calculate the item at $n$-th row, $m$-th column of the simple matrix as $c_{n,m}=c_{n-1,m}+c_{n,m-1}$, where $n&#x2265;1$ and $m&#x2265;1$.<br>Given the two sequences, Huazheng wants to know the value of $c_{n,m}$, but he is too busy with his research to figure it out. Please help him to work it out. By the way, you can assume that $c_{0,0}=0$.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a number $T$ indicating the number of test cases ($T&#x2264;200$).<br>For each test case, there is only one line containing six non-negative integers $b_1,q,a_1,d,n,m$.
