If you remove one vertex which stops you from walking from S to T, that vertex we call as key vertex. Now you are given a directed graph, S and T, and you should tell us how many key vertexes are there in the graph.<br>Please notice that S and T are key vertexes and if S cannot walking to T by the directed edge  in the initial graph then all vertexes becomes to key vertexes.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of multiply test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers, n(0 &lt;= n &lt;= 100000), m(0 &lt;= m &lt;= 300000), which are the number of vertexes and the number of edge. Each of the next m lines consists of two integers, u, v(0 &lt;= u, v &lt; n; u != v), indicating there exists an edge from vertex u to vertex v.  There might be multiple edges but no loops. The last line of each test case contains two integers, S, T(0 &lt;= S, T &lt; n, S != T).<br><br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Output the number of key vertexes in a single line for each test case.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">6 6\n0 1\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n3 4\n4 5\n0 5</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"momodi","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=HDOJ+Monthly+Contest+%A8C+2010.02.06+&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> HDOJ Monthly Contest &#xFFFD;C 2010.02.06  </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
