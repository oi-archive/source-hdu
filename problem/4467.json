T. Tigris is a student currently studying graph theory. One day, when he was studying hard, GS appeared around the corner shyly and came up with a problem:<br>Given a graph with n nodes and m undirected weighted edges, every node having one of two colors, namely black (denoted as 0) and white (denoted as 1), you&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;re to maintain q operations of either kind:<br>* Change x: Change the color of x<sup>th</sup> node. A black node should be changed into white one and vice versa.<br>* Asksum A B: Find the sum of weight of those edges whose two end points are in color A and B respectively. A and B can be either 0 or 1.<br>P. T. Tigris doesn&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t know how to solve this problem, so he turns to you for help.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases.<br>For each test case, the first line contains two integers, n and m (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; n,m &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 10<sup>5</sup>), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges.<br>The second line consists of n integers, the i<sup>th</sup> of which represents the color of the i<sup>th</sup> node: 0 for black and 1 for white.<br>The following m lines represent edges.
