Their current fancy is new shapes for pastures. The old rectangular shapes are out of favor; new geometries are the favorite.<br>I. M. Hei, the lead cow pasture architect, is in charge of creating a triangular pasture surrounded by nice white fence rails. She is supplied with N fence segments and must arrange them into a triangular pasture. Ms. Hei must use all the rails to create three sides of non-zero length. Calculating the number of different kinds of pastures, she can build that enclosed with all fence segments. <br>Two pastures look different if at least one side of both pastures has different lengths, and each pasture should not be degeneration.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is an integer T(T&lt;=15) indicating the number of test cases.<br>The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
