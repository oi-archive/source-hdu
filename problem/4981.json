A median of an array (2, 6, 1, 2, 3) is the number 2, and a median of array (0, 96, 17, 23) &#x2014; the number 17.<br><br>An average of a sequence is the sum of sequence divided the size of the sequence.<br><br>Goffi likes median very much and he hates average number. So if a sequence&apos;s average number is larger than or equal to the median of sequence, Goffi will hate the sequence. Otherwise, Goffi will like it.<br><br>Now, your are given a sequence. Please find whether Goffi will like it or hate it.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input contains multiple test cases (less than 100).
