Patterns are usually specified using a language based on regular expression. In this problem, we&apos;ll use a simple regular expression to express patterns on sequences of decimal digits. A pattern is a sequence of one or more decimal digits `0&apos; ...`9&apos;, asterisks `*&apos;, and hash signs `#&apos;. A `*&apos; denotes a sequence of an even number of digits, whereas a `#&apos; denotes a sequence of an odd number of digits. For example, the pattern ``129&quot; only matches the sequence 129. The pattern ``1*3&quot; matches all sequences beginning with 1, ending with 3, and having an even number of decimal digits between the first and last digits. As another example, the pattern ``#55&quot; matches the sequences 155, 12355, 1234555, but none of the sequences 55, 1255, 123455. Your task is to write a program to find if a given sequence matches a given pattern.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Your program will be tested on one or more data sets.
