Some administrators are at the resting-places.Now we want to build a station in the park to guarantee that no animals run out of the park.Every two resting-places form a segment. If an animal runs accross a segment and thus will never be observed again, we say it is running out of the park. Lines of communication can be built between the station and a certain resting-place, but not between resting-places. Please calculate where the station should be built so that we will always know whether there are any animals running out of the park and at the same time minimize the length of the communication lines.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a positive integer, N(5&lt;=N&lt;=100), the number of resting-places.N lines follow.
