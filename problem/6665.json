The landlord owns a piece of land, which can be regarded as an infinite 2D plane.<br><br>One day the landlord set up two orthogonal rectangular-shaped fences on his land. He asked Calabash a simple problem: how many nonempty connected components is my land divided into by these two fences, both finite and infinite? Calabash couldn&apos;t answer this simple question. Please help him! <br><br>Recall that a connected component is a maximal set of points not occupied by the fences, and every two points in the set are reachable without crossing the fence.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input consists of a single integer $T$ $(1 \\leq T \\leq 10000)$, the number of test cases. <br><br>Each test case contains two lines, specifying the two rectangles.
