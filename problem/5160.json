Every child has his/her desired number of apple ${A_1},{A_2},{A_3}, \\cdots {A_n}$ &#xFF0C; ${A_i}$ indicates the i-th child&#x2019;s desired number of apple. Those children should stand in a line  randomly before we distribute apples. Assume that the i-th position is occupied by  ${p_i} - th$ child, i.e. from left to right the id of the children are ${p_1},{p_2},{p_3}, \\cdots {p_n}$&#xFF0C;So their desired number of apple are ${A_{{p_1}}},{A_{{p_2}}},{A_{{p_3}}}, <br>\\cdots {A_{{p_n}}}$. We will distribute ${A_{{p_1}}}$ apples to the left most child&#xFF0C;and for the i-th (i&gt;1)child&#xFF0C;if there exists a j which makes j &lt; i and ${A_{p_j}} &gt; {A_{{p_i}}}$ true, we will distribute no apples to him/her&#xFF0C;otherwise we will distribute ${A_{{p_i}}}$ apples to him/ner. So for a certain permutation there exist a certain number of apples we should distribute. Now we want to know how many apples we should distribute for all possible permutation.<br>Note: two permutations are considered different if and only if there exists at least a position in which two children&#x2019;s desired number of apple are different.
