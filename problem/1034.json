Each student initially has an even number of pieces of candy. When the teacher blows a whistle, each student simultaneously gives half of his or her candy to the neighbor on the right. Any student, who ends up with an odd number of pieces of candy, is given another piece by the teacher. The game ends when all students have the same number of pieces of candy. <br>Write a program which determines the number of times the teacher blows the whistle and the final number of pieces of candy for each student from the amount of candy each child starts with.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input may describe more than one game.
