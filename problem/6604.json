Country A needs to organize transport teams to deliver supplies toward some command center cities.<br><br>In order to ensure the delivery works efficiently, all the roads in country A work only one direction. Therefore, map of country A can be regarded as DAG( Directed Acyclic Graph ).  Command center cities only received supplies and not send out supplies.<br><br>Intelligence agency of country B is credibly informed that there will be two cities carrying out a critical transporting task in country A. <br><br>As long as **any** one of the two cities can not reach a command center city, the mission fails and country B will hold an enormous advantage. Therefore, country B plans to destroy one of the $n$ cities in country A and all the roads directly connected. (If a city carrying out the task is also a command center city, it is possible to destroy the city to make the mission fail)<br><br>Now country B has made $q$ hypotheses about the two cities carrying out the critical task.<br>Calculate the number of plan that makes the mission of country A fail.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a integer $T$ $(1 \\leq T \\leq 10)$, denoting the number of test cases.<br><br>In each test case, the first line are two integers $n, m$, denoting the number of cities and roads$(1\\leq n\\leq 100,000, 1\\leq m\\leq 200,000)$.<br>Then $m$ lines follow, each with two integers $u$ and $v$, which means there is a directed road from city $u$ to $v$ $(1\\leq u, v\\leq n, u \\neq v)$.<br><br>The next line is a integer q, denoting the number of queries $(1\\leq q\\leq 100,000)$<br>And then $q$ lines follow, each with two integers $a$ and $b$, which means the two cities carrying out the critical task are $a$ and $b$ $(1\\leq a, b\\leq n, a \\neq b)$.<br><br>A city is a command center if and only if there is no road from it (its out degree is zero).","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each query output a line with one integer, means the number of plan that makes the mission of country A fail.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n8 8\n1 2\n3 4\n3 5\n4 6\n4 7\n5 7\n6 8\n7 8\n2\n1 3\n6 7\n3 2\n3 1\n3 2\n2\n1 2\n3 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4\n3\n2\n2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2019+Multi-University+Training+Contest+3&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2019 Multi-University Training Contest 3 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
