The diagram below illustrates both types of folds.<br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/forum/attachment/11_237_47a1e1f8e2d16ad.jpg\"><br>Now, after meticulously folding the strip several times, you are asked to unfold it by making a 90 degree angle at each crease. The example below shows the result of an upper fold, followed by a lower fold and then an unfolding.<br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/forum/attachment/11_237_c1a3e4cf5b00467.jpg\"><br>If the left end of the folded strip is placed at the origin (0,0) and the first right angle is at (1,0), it is natural to ask the questions: Where will the second right angle be located? The third right angle? Where will the other end of the strip be located? Well, that&#x2019;s for us to know and you to figure out.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file will contain multiple test cases. The first line of the file will contain a single integer indicating the number of test cases. Each case will consist of a string of letters U and L indicating a series of upper and lower folds followed by an integer m. The length of the string will be between 1 and 30, inclusive. The value of m identifies a position on the paper. A value of m = 0 indicates the left end (at location (0, 0)). If there are n folds, then a value of m = 2<sup>n</sup> indicates the right end of the strip. Any value for m between these two extremes represents one of the right angles; m = 1 indicates the first right angle, and so on.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output a single line of the form (x,y) indicating the location of the right angle (or end point) specified by the problem. You should assume that if there are n folds in the test case, the length of the string is 2<sup>n</sup> so that the distance between creases is 1 unit long.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\nUL 4\nUL 3\nLLUL 13</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">(2,0)\n(2,-1)\n(1,-2)</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2007+East+Central+North+America&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2007 East Central North America </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
