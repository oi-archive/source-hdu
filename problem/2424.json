Unable to find a suitable calculator in the market with enough precision, Gary has designed a high-precision calculator himself. Can you help him to write the necessary program that will make his design possible?<br>For simplicity, you only need to consider two kinds of calculations in your program: addition and multiplication. It is guaranteed that all input numbers to the calculator are non-negative and without leading zeroes.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases in the input file.
