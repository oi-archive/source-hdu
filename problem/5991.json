Consider a undirected graph G with n nodes. We hope to modify G into a new graph such that each connected component of it should be a clique. Each step of modification can be inserting a new edge or deleting an edge which has already existed.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer t which is the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line consists of an integer n (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; n &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 100) which is the number of nodes in undirected graph G. Each of the following n lines consists of n integers corresponding to the adjacency matrix of G where 1 represents the existence of the edge and 0 otherwise.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output first the case number, see the sample output. There should be a space after the colon in each test case. Then, if the graph G can be modified into a new graph with no more than ten steps, output the minimum number of steps we need, or - 1 if not.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n7\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 1 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0 1 1 0\n1\n0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 2\nCase #2: 0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2016ACM%2FICPC%D1%C7%D6%DE%C7%F8%C7%E0%B5%BA%D5%BE-%D6%D8%CF%D6%C8%FC%A3%A8%B8%D0%D0%BB%D6%D0%B9%FA%CA%AF%D3%CD%B4%F3%D1%A7%A3%A9&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2016ACM/ICPC&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xD7A;&#x57E;-&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x43B;&#xFFFD;&#x439;&#xFFFD;&#x2AF;&#xFFFD;&#x374;&#xFFFD;&#x467;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
