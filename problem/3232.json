You decided to follow the straight path between your house (A) and the working place (B), but there are several rivers you need to cross. Assume B is to the right of A, and all the rivers lie between them.<br><br>Fortunately, there is one &quot;automatic&quot; boat moving smoothly in each river. When you arrive the left bank of a river, just wait for the boat, then go with it. You&apos;re so slim that carrying you does not change the speed of any boat.<br><br>Days and days after, you came up with the following question: assume each boat is independently placed at random at time 0, what is the <b>expected</b> time to reach B from A? Your walking speed is always 1.<br><br>To be more precise, for a river of length L, the distance of the boat (which could be regarded as a mathematical point) to the left bank at time 0 is <b>uniformly chosen</b> from interval [0, <i>L</i>], and the boat is equally like to be moving left or right, if it&#x2019;s not precisely at the river bank.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There will be at most 10 test cases. Each case begins with two integers <i>n</i> and <i>D</i>, where <i>n</i> (0 &lt;= <i>n</i> &lt;= 10) is the number of rivers between A and B, <i>D</i> (1 &lt;= <i>D</i> &lt;= 1000) is the distance from A to B. Each of the following <i>n</i> lines describes a river with 3 integers: <i>p, L</i> and <i>v</i> (0 &lt;= <i>p</i> &lt; <i>D</i>, 0 &lt; <i>L</i> &lt;= <i>D</i>, 1 &lt;= <i>v</i> &lt;= 100). <i>p</i> is the distance from A to the left bank of this river, <i>L</i> is the length of this river, <i>v</i> is the speed of the boat on this river.
