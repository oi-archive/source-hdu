Many  people  spend  several weekends  or  even  full weeks improving their skills in the mountains.  <br>In  this  problem we  deal with  only  one  of  the multiple  alpine  skiing  disciplines:  slalom. A course  is  constructed  by  laying  out  a  series  of  gates, which  are  formed  by  two  poles.  The skier must pass between the  two poles  forming each gate. The winner  is the skier who  takes the least time to complete the course while not missing any of the gates.  <br>You have recently started to learn to ski, but you have already set yourself the goal of taking part  in  the Winter  Olympic  Games  of    2022,  for  which  Syria  will  presumably  present  a candidature. As part of  the theoretical  training, you need  to write a program  that calculates, given a starting point and a series of gates,  the minimum-length path starting  from  the point given and passing through each gate until you reach the last one, which is the finish line. You may assume that the gates are horizontal and are ordered from highest to lowest, so that you need to pass through them in order. You consider yourself an accomplished skier, so you can make any series of  turns, no matter how difficult, and your only concern  is minimizing  the total length of the path. ","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of each case gives the number of gates n (1 &#x2264; n &#x2264; 1 000). The next line contains two floating point numbers, the Cartesian coordinates x and y of the starting position, in that order. Next come n  lines with  three  floating point numbers  each, y x1 x2, meaning  that  the next gate  is a horizontal  line  from  (x1,y)  to  (x2,y). You can safely assume  that x1 &lt;x2. The values of y  are  strictly decreasing  and  are  always  smaller  than  that of  the  starting position.The  last gate  represents  the  finish  line. All coordinates are between -500 000 and 500 000,inclusive. A value of 0 for n means the end of the input. A blank line follows each case.
