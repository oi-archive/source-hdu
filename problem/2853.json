The assignment is measure by efficiency, which is an integer, and the larger the better.<br>We have N companies of troops and M missions, M&gt;=N. One company can get only one mission. One mission can be assigned to only one company. If company i takes mission j, we can get efficiency Eij. <br>We have a assignment plan already, and now we want to change some companies&#x2019; missions to make the total efficiency larger. And also we want to change as less companies as possible.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"For each test case, the first line contains two numbers N and M. N lines follow. Each contains M integers, representing Eij. The next line contains N integers. The first one represents the mission number that company 1 takes, and so on.<br>1&lt;=N&lt;=M&lt;=50, 1&lt;Eij&lt;=10000.<br>Your program should process to the end of file.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each the case print two integers X and Y.
