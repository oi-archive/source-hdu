They go shopping together and buy the same. However, they don&apos;t bring the same units money with themselves so one of them suggests that the one with the most money should borrow 1 unit money to someone else with equal probability. That is to say, if they have $x, y, z(x \\ge y \\ge z)$ units money separately, the one with $x$ units money (if multiple people have the most then they decide one should borrow with equal probability) will give 1 unit to one of his/her friends with equal probability. After that, they have $x - 1, y + 1, z$ or $x - 1, y, z + 1$ units money.<br><br>  This act will last until everyone has the same units money. Three smart guys want to know the expected times of this act or if this situation will never come.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases.<br>The first line contains a single integer $T$, indicating the number of test cases.<br>Following $T$ lines, each line contains three integer $x, y, z$ indicating the money of three guys.<br><br>$x + y + z \\le 10^6, \\sum{x + y + z} \\le 3\\times 10^6$","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, if the situation that everyone has the same units money will never come then print $- 1$, else print the expected times in a line.
