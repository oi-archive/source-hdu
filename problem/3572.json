Her factory has introduced M new machines in order to process the coming N tasks. For the i-th task, the factory has to start processing it at or after day Si, process it for Pi days, and finish the task before or at day Ei. A machine can only work on one task at a time, and each task can be processed by at most one machine at a time. However, a task can be interrupted and processed on different machines on different days. <br>Now she wonders whether he has a feasible schedule to finish all the tasks in time. She turns to you for help.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"On the first line comes an integer T(T&lt;=20), indicating the number of test cases.<br><br>You are given two integer N(N&lt;=500) and M(M&lt;=200) on the first line of each test case.
