The replacement relation is 312546 (indicate 1-&gt;2, 2-&gt;3, 3-&gt;1, 4-&gt;5, 5-&gt;4, 6-&gt;6, the relation is also an arrangement distinctly).<br>After the first permutation, the arrangement will be 312546. And then it will be 231456.<br>In this permutation relation (312546), the arrangement will be altered into the order 312546, 231456, 123546, 312456, 231546 and it will always go back to the beginning, so the length of the loop section of this permutation relation equals to 6.<br>Your task is to calculate how many kinds of the length of this loop section in any permutation relations.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input contains multiple test cases.
