For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. Similarly 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, ... is a geometric sequence with common ratio 1/2.<br><br>Examples of a geometric sequence are powers $r^k$ of a fixed number r, such as $2^k$ and $3^k$. The general form of a geometric sequence is<br><br>$a,\\ ar,\\ ar^2,\\ ar^3,\\ ar^4,\\ \\ldots$<br><br>where r &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 0 is the common ratio and a is a scale factor, equal to the sequence&apos;s start value.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"First line contains a single integer $T (T \\leq 20)$ which denotes the number of test cases. <br><br>For each test case, there is an positive integer $n (1 \\leq n \\leq 100)$ which denotes the length of sequence,and next line has $n$ nonnegative numbers $A_i$ which allow leading zero.The digit&apos;s length of $A_i$ no larger than $100$.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each case, output &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4\n1\n0\n3\n1 1 1\n3\n1 4 2\n5\n16 8 4 2 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Yes\nYes\nNo\nYes</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=BestCoder+Round+%2354+%28div.2%29&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> BestCoder Round #54 (div.2) </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
