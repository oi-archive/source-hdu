After learning Chengdu is a beautiful city, David decides to buy his friends some gifts.<br><br>The capacity of David&apos;s pocket is so small that it can only contain M gifts. Considering the diversity of his gifts, David would not buy two of the same kind. And some typical gift should be chosen to represent the features of Chengdu.<br><br>David will walk down from north to south and visit N shops one by one along the shopping street. There is ONLY ONE type of gift sold in each shop.<br><br>David has such a poor memory that he can&apos;t remember how many shops sell gift K . So he will write a number L on this gift he bought in his pocket, to indicate how many shops where sell gift K . In David&apos;s opinion, the smaller the number L is, the better the gift (David like uncommon gifts).<br><br>When David stops in a shop which sells gift K , the following three situations he might come across.<br><br>   1. If there is not gift K in his pocket and still some place for it, He will buy without hesitation. Before putting it into the pocket, David will write down the number `1&apos; on the gift to indicate that he has once seen one shop selling it.<br>   2. If there is gift K in his pocket, David will just replace the number L with L + 1 , indicating L + 1 shops sell gift K .<br>   3. If there is not gift K in his pocket and the pocket is full, David would like to regard no shops selling gift K (because he cannot remember whether or not he has met gift K ), so he will have to discard one gift in his pocket to release a place for the gift K . But which gift should be discarded? According to the follow rule:<br><br>      He chooses the gift that has the biggest number L on it. If several gifts have the same biggest number L , he will discard the one which has been putted into the pocket at the earliest time. After discarding the gift, he will put gift K into his pocket and write number `1&apos; on gift K . <br><br><br>Now, your task is to write a program to record the number of these gifts which have been discarded by David.<br><br><br>For example:<br><br>David&apos;s pocket has the capacity only for two gifts. There are 5 shops in the street, and each shop sells only one type of gift. The selling sequence of gifts is 1, 2, 1, 3, and 1.<br><br>In shop 1, the pocket is empty, so he will buy gift 1, write a number `1&apos; on this gift, and then put it into his pocket.<br><br>When he comes to shop 2, there is one place left in his pocket, so he buys gift 2, write a number `1&apos; on it, and then put it into the pocket.<br><br>When walking into shop 3, he has already got gift 1 in his pocket, so he will replace the number L (here, L = 1 ) with L + 1 .<br><br>When David visits shop 4, the pocket is full, but without gift 3 in it, so he has to discard one gift to release a place for gift 3. The number L on gift 1 is `2&apos;, but the number L on gift 2 is `1&apos;, so he will discard gift 1, write number 1 on gift 3 and then put it into the pocket.<br><br>In shop 5, the pocket is full, gift 1 is not in it, he should will discard a gift to find place for gift 1. The number L on gift 2 is `1&apos;, the number L on gift 3 is also `1&apos;. They have the same L , but gift 2 put into the pocket earlier than gift 3. So he discards gift 2, write number `1&apos; on gift 1 and then put it into the pocket. At the end of the street, David gets two gifts in his pocket, number `1&apos; on gift 3 and number `1&apos; on gift 1. The number of discarded gifts is 2.
