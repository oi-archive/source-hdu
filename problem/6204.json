We have a regular n-gon: a convex polygon with $n$ sides, in which all sides have the same length and all internal angles are equal. We want to draw $n-3$ non-intersecting diagonals in some way. Once we do that, we will have the polygon divided into exactly $n-2$ triangles. We want to produce a situation in which one of these $n-2$ triangles has a $strictly$ larger area than each of the remaining $n-3$ triangles.<br>The vertices of the polygon are labeled $1$ through $n$ in clockwise order. Two sets of diagonals are different if one of them contains a diagonal that is not exist in the other one. Count all sets of $n-3$ non-intersecting diagonals that produce an arrangement with the above property. Output the number modulo $x$ multiple the number modulo $y$.<br>I can&apos;t solve it. Can you help me?<br>For example , the number of the first case is $(0\\% 5)*(0\\% 6)=0$,the number of the second case is $(5\\% 6)*(5\\% 7)=25$.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"First line contains an integer $T$ ($T \\leq 2$), the number of test cases.<br>For each test case, there are three numbers $n, x, y$ in a line separated by blanks ($3 \\leq n \\leq 400, 1 \\leq x, y \\leq 10^9$).<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print a single number in a line which is described above.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n4 5 6\n5 6 7</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">0\n25</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2017+ACM%2FICPC+Asia+Regional+Shenyang+Online&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2017 ACM/ICPC Asia Regional Shenyang Online </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
