It is sometimes referred to as base-&#x3C6;, golden mean base, phi-base, or, phi-nary.<br><br>Any non-negative real number can be represented as a base-&#x3C6; numeral using only the digits 0 and 1, and avoiding the digit sequence &quot;11&quot; &#x2013; this is called a standard form. A base-&#x3C6; numeral that includes the digit sequence &quot;11&quot; can always be rewritten in standard form, using the algebraic properties of the base &#x3C6; &#x2014; most notably that &#x3C6; + 1 = &#x3C6; <sup>2</sup> . For instance, 11(&#x3C6;) = 100(&#x3C6;). Despite using an irrational number base, when using standard form, all on-negative integers have a unique representation as a terminating (finite) base-&#x3C6; expansion. The set of numbers which possess a finite base-&#x3C6; representation is the ring Z[1 + &#x221A;5/2]; it plays the same role in this numeral systems as dyadic rationals play in binary numbers, providing a possibility to multiply.<br><br>Other numbers have standard representations in base-&#x3C6;, with rational numbers having recurring representations. These representations are unique, except that numbers (mentioned above) with a terminating expansion also have a non-terminating expansion, as they do in base-10; for example, 1=0.99999&#x2026;.<br><br>Coach MMM, an Computer Science Professor who is also addicted to Mathematics, is extremely interested in GRB and now ask you for help to write a converter which, given an integer N in base-10, outputs its corresponding form in base-&#x3C6;.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
