In this game, one can build so many(about 100,000) submarines, and detect and collect underwater treasures.<br>A submarine use radar to detect treasures. Alexandra&apos;s submarines are all face north. For each submarine, its radar can detect treasures between northwest and northeast. For example, the &quot;S&quot; is the submarine, and the &quot;+&quot; is a grid which the submarine can detect, and the &quot;-&quot; is which it cannot detect:<br>++++-<br>+++--<br>-S---<br>-----<br>Note: the submarine can also detect the grid it occupies.<br>To simplify the problem, we build coordinate system on the map. X-axis goes from north to south, and Y-axis from west to east. We define the distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) to be max(abs(x1-x2),abs(y1-y2)).<br>There is something special with the radar. Each submarine has a value D. The submarine can only detect a treasure, if D is a divisor of the distance between the submarine and the treasure. Don&apos;t forget any D is a divisor of 0.<br>Here comes the problem: Given the map of size N*M, and Q submarines&apos; position and D, for each submarine please output the number of treasures it can detect.<br>Note: in this problem, we only detect treasures and won&apos;t collect them, so the submarines don&apos;t affect each other.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases (no more than 30).<br>For each case, the first line is three positive integers N, M and Q.<br>Next N lines is a map of size N*M. &quot;X&quot; means treasure and &quot;.&quot; means no treasure.<br>Next Q lines, each line is the description of a submarine.
