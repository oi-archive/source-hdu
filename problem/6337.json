You are curious about the checking results of type-5 events, and decide to work out it timely according to the given information.<br>In order to keep your algorithm online, the input has been encrypted. You should `XOR` the current number of <b>type-5 events whose result is `Yes`</b> to each $l, r$ and $x$, to get the real input.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.<br>Each test case starts with an integer $q$ $(1 \\le q \\le 50000, \\sum{q} \\le 10 ^ 6)$ denoting the number of events.<br>Each of next $q$ lines contains an encrypted event, remember to decrypt it first!<br>* $0 \\le x \\le 10 ^ 6$ for type-2 events<br>* $|x| \\le 10 ^ {12}$ for type-1, type-5 events<br>* $|l|, |r| \\le 10 ^ {12}, l \\le r$ for type-3 events<br>* It is guaranteed that $x$ is less than the current number of events for type-4 events.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print `Yes` or `No` for each type-5 event.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\t\t\n9\t\t\n2 5\t\n5 6\t\n3 1 10\n5 6\t\n1 0\t\n5 2\t\n5 0\t\n4 0\t\n5 7</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">No\nYes\nNo\nYes\nYes</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2018+Multi-University+Training+Contest+4&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2018 Multi-University Training Contest 4 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
