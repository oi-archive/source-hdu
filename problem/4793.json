There&apos;s also a round range  which shares exact the same center as the round medal, and radius of the medal is  strictly less than radius of the round range. Since that the round medal is fixed and the  coin is a piece of solid metal, we can assume that energy of the coin will not lose, the  coin will collide and then moving as reflect.<br>Now assume that the center of the round medal and the round range is origin  ( Namely (0, 0) ) and the coin&apos;s initial position is strictly outside the round range.<br>Given radius of the medal R<sub>m</sub>, radius of coin r, radius of the round range R, initial  position (x, y) and initial speed vector (vx, vy) of the coin, please calculate the total  time that any part of the coin is inside the round range. Please note that the coin might not even touch the medal or slip through the round  range.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There will be several test cases.
