Cuber QQ thought it will be interesting to count the occurrences of some words in this paper note, thus he brought in a dictionary. If you are curious about what occurrences mean, here are some examples: &quot;nan&quot; appears once in &quot;banana&quot;; &quot;a&quot; appears 3 times in &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;ana&quot; appears twice in &quot;banana&quot;.<br><br>When Cuber QQ got up the second day, he forgot all about his counting yesterday, and he figured he had to do that again. So he used a highlight pen and highlighted those occurrences. Note that a letter can&apos;t be highlighted more than once. For example, finding &quot;ana&quot; in &quot;banana&quot; will result in highlighting altogether 5 letters.<br><br>On the third day, Cuber QQ again noticed a problem he could have noticed on the second day. He can&apos;t tell the number of occurrences from his highlighting because of some touching or overlapping area. If you are counting &quot;a&quot; in &quot;banana&quot;, you will get 3; that&apos;s fine. Counting &quot;an&quot; or &quot;ana&quot; will all give you the wrong count, which is 1. Cuber QQ has finally given up and named his incorrect counting as Cuber Occurrence.<br><br>Let&apos;s do a more complicated example to make sure everything is clear. Cuber Occurrence of &quot;cuc&quot; in &quot;cucucuberqqcucuber&quot; is 2, and that of &quot;q&quot; is 1 (since two &quot;q&quot; are touching each other), and that of &quot;u&quot; is 5.<br><br>Cuber QQ couldn&apos;t help wondering the opposite problem. If he knows the Cuber Occurrence of a word in a string, could you find him this word?<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$), indicating there are $t$ tests.<br><br>The follows $t$ test cases, Each test consists of two lines.
