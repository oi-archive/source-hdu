Professor Zhang wants to use all the characters build several palindromic strings. He also wants to maximize the length of the shortest palindromic string.<br><br>For example, there are 4 kinds of characters denoted as &apos;a&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, &apos;c&apos;, &apos;d&apos; and the quantity of each character is $\\{2,3,2,2\\}$ . Professor Zhang can build {&quot;acdbbbdca&quot;}, {&quot;abbba&quot;, &quot;cddc&quot;}, {&quot;aca&quot;, &quot;bbb&quot;, &quot;dcd&quot;}, or {&quot;acdbdca&quot;, &quot;bb&quot;}. The first is the optimal solution where the length of the shortest palindromic string is 9.<br><br>Note that a string is called palindromic if it can be read the same way in either direction.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
