Since abandoned for a long time, the roads need to be re-built. There are $m (m \\leq 1000000)$ roads to be re-built, the length of each road is $w_{i} (w_{i} \\leq 1000000)$. Guaranteed that any two $w_{i}$ are different. The roads made all the villages connected directly or indirectly before destroyed. Every road will cost the same value of its length to rebuild. The king wants to use the minimum cost to make all the villages connected with each other directly or indirectly. After the roads are re-built, the king asks a men as messenger. The king will select any two different points as starting point or the destination with the same probability. Now the king asks you to tell him the minimum cost and the minimum expectations length the messenger will walk.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer $T (T \\leq 10)$ which indicates the number of test cases. <br><br>For each test case, the first line contains two integers $n, m$ indicate the number of villages and the number of roads to be re-built.
