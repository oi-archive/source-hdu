Shadow repeats these operations until he can&#x2019;t or doesn&#x2019;t want to anymore.<br>Shadow can&#x2019;t rotate or overturn the paper, do you know how many different ways can he draw lines and paint colors.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is one integer T indicates the number of test cases.
