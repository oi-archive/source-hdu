In order to evaluate the influence brought by the catastrophe, the king wanted to know the instability of his kingdom. Instability is defined as the number of the unstable subset of {1, 2,$\\cdots $,n}.<br><br>A set S is unstable if and only if there exists a set A such that $A\\subseteq S(|A|\\geq 3$) and A is a <b>clique</b> or an <b>independent set</b>, namely that cites in A are pairwise connected <b>directly</b> or they are pairwise disconnected.<br><br>Archaeologist has already restored themroads that were not destroyed by the monster.
