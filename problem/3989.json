But at the very beginning, she didn&apos;t know the prescription, so she had to try several materials to make it up. After that, she found there were only twenty materials which could possibly make the polyjuice potion. And she also noticed that some combination of the materials of the twenty materials will get an effect Ei(-1000 &lt; Ei &lt; 1000).If she choose a subset S of the materials, the final effect will be the sum of effect values of all combinations appeared in S. Because Hermione is very clever, she calculated all the effect value of the combinations.
