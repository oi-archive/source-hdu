He always stays up late for training. He needs enough time to sleep, and hates skipping classes. So he always sleeps in the class. With the final exams coming, he has to spare some time to listen to the teacher. Today, he hears that the teacher will have a revision class. The class is N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000) minutes long. If ZZZ listens to the teacher in the i-th minute, he can get Ai points (1&lt;=Ai&lt;=1000). If he starts listening, he will listen to the teacher at least L (1 &lt;= L &lt;= N) minutes consecutively. It`s the most important that he must have at least M (1 &lt;= M &lt;= N) minutes for sleeping (the M minutes needn`t be consecutive). Suppose ZZZ knows the points he can get in every minute. Now help ZZZ to compute the maximal points he can get.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several cases.
