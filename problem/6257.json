So, for a college student major in computer science, playing games may not always be an enjoyable process. <br><br>Today, Rikka is doing some research about a simple, but an interesting game about trees. <br><br>Given a rooted tree $T$, at first, there is a token on the root. Two players play games on this tree using the token alternately. In each turn, assume the token&apos;s position is $i$, the player needs to choose a child $j$ of $i$ and move the token to $j$.  If $i$ has no child, the game will end immediately.<br><br>The final score of the game is the depth of the final position of the token (the depth of the root is $1$). And the first player wants to maximize the score while the second player wants to minimize the score. Assume both of the two players play optimally.<br><br>Given the rooted tree $T$, calculating the final score of the game is a simple task. So Rikka wants to solve a more challenging task. She can do some operations to the tree, each time, she can choose a $leaf$ $i$ from the tree (i.e. the chosen node mustn&apos;t have any children) and link a new node to the tree with node $i$ as its father. <br><br>Let $f(k)$ be the minimum number of operations to make the game&apos;s final score be exactly $k$. If it is impossible, $f(k)$ will be $-1$. And Rikka wants to know $\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty}\\frac{f(k)}{k}$.<br><br>You know, Rikka is a good questioner, but not a good task solver. So, she asks you for some help.<br><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single number $t(1\\leq t \\leq 10^3)$.<br><br>For each testcase, the first line contains two numbers $n(1\\leq n \\leq 10^5)$.<br><br>Then $n-1$ lines follow, each line contains two integers $u,v(1 \\leq u,v \\leq n)$ which describes the tree.
