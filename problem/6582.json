But, because he spends too much time with his girlfriend, Tom feels neglected and wants to prevent him from visiting her.<br>After doing some research on the neighbourhood, Tom found that the neighbourhood consists of exactly $n$ houses, and some of them are connected with directed road. To visit his girlfriend, Jerry needs to start from his house indexed $1$ and go along the shortest path to hers, indexed $n$. <br>Now Tom wants to block some of the roads so that Jerry has to walk longer to reach his girl&apos;s home, and he found that the cost of blocking a road equals to its length. Now he wants to know the minimum total cost to make Jerry walk longer.<br>Note, if Jerry can&apos;t reach his girl&apos;s house in the very beginning, the answer is obviously zero. And you don&apos;t need to guarantee that there still exists a way from Jerry&apos;s house to his girl&apos;s after blocking some edges.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input begins with a line containing one integer $T(1\\le T\\le 10)$, the number of test cases.<br>Each test case starts with a line containing two numbers $n,m(1\\le n,m\\le 10000)$, the number of houses and the number of one-way roads in the neighbourhood.<br>$m$ lines follow, each of which consists of three integers $x,y,c(1\\le x,y\\le n,1\\le c\\le 10^9)$, denoting that there exists a one-way road from the house indexed $x$ to $y$ of length $c$.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"Print $T$ lines, each line containing a integer, the answer.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n3 4\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n1 3 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2019+Multi-University+Training+Contest+1&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2019 Multi-University Training Contest 1 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
