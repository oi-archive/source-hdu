Each player has an equipped-item area to hold equipments. A player is allowed to own only one of each of these 4 equipments in the equipped-item area. Equipments can be replaced by one of the same kind. However, after the replacement, the previous ones would be discarded. For simplicity, cards not belong to equipment (tool cards, basic cards and so on) are united as &quot;Other Card&quot; ignoring their functions in this problem.<br><br>Sun Shangxiang(Nickname: Xiangxiang), the lady with bow and arrows, is one of the favorable characters in this game. Her 2nd character ability - &quot;Warrior Lady&quot; (&#x67AD;&#x59EC;xi&#x101;o j&#x12B; in Chinese) is described below:<br><br>Whenever an equipped card is discarded from the equipped-item area, Xiangxiang can immediately draw 2 cards from the deck. Note that Xiangxiang cannot voluntarily remove her equipped items. She can only replace them.<br><br>Now it is Xiangxiang&#x2019;s turn. She has a certain amount of cards of each kind in her hand and her equipped-item area is empty. Given the number of cards of each kind in the deck, assume that every card in the deck will be taken with equal probability, and Xiangxiang will always equip the &quot;Equipment Card&quot; once she gets it.
