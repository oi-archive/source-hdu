After playing &quot;arcane numbers&quot;, they find a new game &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;arcane numbers 2&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;. The game is also pretty simple. Vance first chooses 3 non-negative integers A, B and N, then he writes down B+A, B+A*2&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;B+A*N under base 2 and sends it to Shackler, after that Vance will ask him how many 1s are there in the sequence. However, the sequence is too long for Shackler and he turns to you for help. Given you A, B and N, please help Shackler to solve the problem.
