He is consolidating the cannonballs into one location, and decides to use pyramids with triangular bases rather than ones with square bases.<br><br>In Civil War memorials with cannons and stacks of cannonballs, the cannonballs were sometimes stacked as a four-sided pyramid, with the base as a square of cannonballs with n balls on each side. An alternative is to stack them in a three-sided pyramid, which is in fact one of the Platonic solids, a tetrahedron.<br><br>This tetrahedron of cannonballs has a base that is an equilateral triangle of cannonballs with <b>n</b> balls on each side. The number of balls in that triangle is given simply by adding together the numbers from 1 to <b>n</b>. On top of each layer (starting from the base) is a triangle with one less ball on each side, up to the top-most layer with a single ball.<br><br>Given the number of cannonballs on each side of the base, compute the total number of cannonballs in the entire tetrahedral stack.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single number <b>n</b>, giving the number of tetrahedral problems posed, for a maximum of 100 problems.
