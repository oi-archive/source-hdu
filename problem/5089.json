As a problem setter, it&#x2019;s always tough to choose appropriate problem ideas from the varieties. The problems cannot be too hard, because it will dampen your enthusiasm, but too easy, it will bore you. So iSea want to choose K problems so that probability to solve K-1 problems to be the highest, given the probability to solve each problem for players.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer T, indicating the number of test cases. <br><br>Each test case begins with two integers N and K, indicating the number of problems and the number of problems to be selected.
