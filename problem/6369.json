Rectangular obstacles can overlap each other. Each rectangular obstacle is specified as two points on 2D plane that specify the opposite corners of a rectangle. Your job is to calculate the outline of the coverage area of all rectangular.<br><br>If the outline is made up of more than one closed polyline, print &quot;Oops!&quot;. Otherwise, output the answer as follows: The first output point has the smallest X coordinate and then smallest Y coordinate. The second point has the same X coordinate with the first point.
