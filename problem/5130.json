The territory of A-Land is a simple polygon with no more than 500 vertices. For military use, A-Land constructed a radio tower (also written as A), and it&apos;s so powerful that the whole country was under its signal. To interfere A-Land&apos;s communication, B-Land decided to build another radio tower (also written as B). According to an accurate estimation, for any point P, if the euclidean distance between P and B is no more than k (0.2 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; k &lt; 0.8) times of the distance between P and A, then point P is not able to receive clear signals from A, i.e. be interfered. Your task is to calculate the area in A-Land&apos;s territory that are under B-Land&apos;s interference. ","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   There are no more than 100 test cases in the input.<br><br>   In each test case, firstly you are given a positive integer N indicating the amount of vertices on A-Land&apos;s territory, and an above mentioned real number k, which is rounded to 4 digits after the decimal point. <br><br>   Then N lines follow. Each line contains two integers x and y (|x|, |y| &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 1000), indicating a vertex&apos;s coordinate on A&apos;s territory, in counterclockwise or clockwise order. <br><br>   The last two lines of a test case give radio tower A and B&apos;s coordinates in the same form as vertexes&apos; coordinates.  You can assume that A is not equal to B.
