In daily life, I always receive a lot of mission, and I must complete it right now.<br>Today, team leader announced me that there is a huge spaceship dropping anchor in the out space, and we should reach there for rescue. As a working principle, at first, we should check whether there are persons living in the spaceship. So we carry a kind of machine called life sensor which can sense the life phenomenon when the distance between the machine and the living is not farther than the sense radius.<br>I have read the designing paper of the spaceship in advance. It has a form of a convex polyhedron, and we can assume it is isodense. For best control, control center of the whole ship is located at the center of the mass. It is sure that if someone is still alive, he will stay at the control center.<br>It&apos;s unfortunately that I find the door is stocked when I try to enter into the spaceship, so I can only sense the living out of the space ship. Now I have opened the machine and it&apos;s time to set the sense radius of it. I wonder the minimal radius of the machine which can allowe me to check whether there are persons living in the spaceship.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.<br>The first line contains an integer n indicating the number of vertices of the polyhedron.
