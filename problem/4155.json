The game is played with a deck of 24 cards: four labelled each of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The cards in the deck are visible to both players, who alternately withdraw one card from the deck and place it on a pile. The object of the game is to be the last player to lay a card such that the sum of the cards in the pile does not exceed 31. Your task is to determine the eventual winner of a partially played game, assuming each player plays the remainder of the game using a perfect strategy.<br>For example, in the following game player B wins:<br> Player     A     plays     3<br>Player     B     plays     5<br>Player     A     plays     6<br>Player     B     plays     6<br>Player     A     plays     5<br>Player     B     plays     6","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input will consist of several lines; each line consists of a sequence of zero or more digits representing a partially completed game.
