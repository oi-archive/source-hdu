If you do not understand a word of this paragraph, just move on.<br>The Nya graph is an undirected graph with &quot;layers&quot;. Each node in the graph belongs to a layer, there are N nodes in total.<br>You can move from any node in layer x to any node in layer x + 1, with cost C, since the roads are bi-directional, moving from layer x + 1 to layer x is also allowed with the same cost.<br>Besides, there are M extra edges, each connecting a pair of node u and v, with cost w.<br>Help us calculate the shortest path from node 1 to node N.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line has a number T (T &lt;= 20) , indicating the number of test cases.<br>For each test case, first line has three numbers N, M (0 &lt;= N, M &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup>) and C(1 &lt;= C &lt;= 10<sup>3</sup>), which is the number of nodes, the number of extra edges and cost of moving between adjacent layers.<br>The second line has N numbers l<sub>i</sub> (1 &lt;= l<sub>i</sub> &lt;= N), which is the layer of i<sup>th</sup> node belong to.<br>Then come N lines each with 3 numbers, u, v (1 &lt;= u, v &lt; =N, u &lt;&gt; v) and w (1 &lt;= w &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup>), which means there is an extra edge, connecting a pair of node u and v, with cost w.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For test case X, output &quot;Case #X: &quot; first, then output the minimum cost moving from node 1 to node N.<br>If there are no solutions, output -1.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n3 3 3\n1 3 2\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 3\n\n3 3 3\n1 3 2\n1 2 2\n2 3 2\n1 3 4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 2\nCase #2: 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2013+ACM%2FICPC+Asia+Regional+Online+%A1%AA%A1%AA+Warmup2&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2013 ACM/ICPC Asia Regional Online &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; Warmup2 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
