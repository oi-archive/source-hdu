In other words, find that 10-digit sequence and then connect to the web site&#x2014; and find out that Google is trying to hire people who can solve a particular kind of problem. Not to be outdone, Gaggle (a loosy-goosy fuzzy logic search firm), has devised its own recruiting problem. Consider the base 7 expansion of a rational number. For example, the first few digits of the base 7 expansion of 1/5<sub>10</sub> = 0.12541...<sub>7</sub>,33/4<sub>10</sub> = 11.15151...<sub>7</sub>, and 6/49<sub>10</sub> = 0.06000...<sub>7</sub>, From this expansion, find the digits in a particular range of positions to the right of the &quot;decimal&quot; point.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file begins with a line containing a single integer specifying the number of problem sets in the file.
