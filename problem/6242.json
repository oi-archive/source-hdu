She found a interesting problem and solved it easily. Now she will give this problem to you :<br><br>You are given $N$ distinct points $(X_i,Y_i)$ on the two-dimensional plane. Your task is to find a point $P$ and a real number $R$, such that for at least $\\lceil \\frac{N}{2} \\rceil$ given points, their distance to point $P$ is equal to $R$.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is the number of test cases.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains one positive number $N(1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5)$.<br><br>The following $N$ lines describe the points. Each line contains two real numbers $X_i$ and $Y_i$ $(0 \\leq |X_i|, |Y_i| \\leq 10^3)$ indicating one give point. It&apos;s guaranteed that $N$ points are distinct.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output a single line with three real numbers $X_P, Y_P, R$, where $(X_P,Y_P)$ is the coordinate of required point $P$. <b>Three real numbers you output should satisfy $0 \\leq |X_P|, |Y_P|, R \\leq 10^9$.</b><br><br>It is guaranteed that there exists at least one solution satisfying all conditions. And if there are different solutions, print any one of them. The judge will regard two point&apos;s distance as $R$ if it is within an absolute error of $10^{-3}$ of $R$.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n7\n1 1\n1 0\n1 -1\n0 1\n-1 1\n0 -1\n-1 0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">0 0 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2017%D6%D0%B9%FA%B4%F3%D1%A7%C9%FA%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%BE%BA%C8%FC-%B9%FE%B6%FB%B1%F5%D5%BE-%D6%D8%CF%D6%C8%FC%A3%A8%B8%D0%D0%BB%B9%FE%C0%ED%B9%A4%A3%A9&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2017&#xFFFD;&#x439;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x467;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x1BE;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;-&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x57E;-&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x43B;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
