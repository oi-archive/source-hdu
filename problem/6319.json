They are labeled by $1$ to $n$ from left to right. It can be easily found that the $i$-th contestant&apos;s QodeForces rating is $a_i$.<br>Little Q, the coach of Quailty Normal University, is bored to just watch them waiting in the queue. He starts to compare the rating of the contestants. He will pick a continous interval with length $m$, say $[l,l+m-1]$, and then inspect each contestant from left to right. Initially, he will write down two numbers $maxrating=-1$ and $count=0$. Everytime he meets a contestant $k$ with strictly higher rating than $maxrating$, he will change $maxrating$ to $a_k$ and $count$ to $count+1$.<br>Little T is also a coach waiting for the contest. He knows Little Q is not good at counting, so he is wondering what are the correct final value of $maxrating$ and $count$. Please write a program to figure out the answer.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T(1\\leq T\\leq2000)$, denoting the number of test cases.<br>In each test case, there are $7$ integers $n,m,k,p,q,r,MOD(1\\leq m,k\\leq n\\leq 10^7,5\\leq p,q,r,MOD\\leq 10^9)$ in the first line, denoting the number of contestants, the length of interval, and the parameters $k,p,q,r,MOD$.<br>In the next line, there are $k$ integers $a_1,a_2,...,a_k(0\\leq a_i\\leq 10^9)$, denoting the rating of the first $k$ contestants.<br>To reduce the large input, we will use the following generator.
