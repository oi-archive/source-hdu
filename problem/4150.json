As a righteous magician, james0zan want to find the most powerful incantation so he can beat those dangerous witches easily.<br>After consulted one hundred and eight thousand Magic Books, james0zan find a way to calculate the power of an incantation. There is a very short incantation called &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;magic index&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; which contains the magic power, and each incantation&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s power can be calculated by the times the &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;magic index&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; appearance in the incantation. Notice that if two &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;magic index&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; overlapped, the power only should be calculated once. And we just want the incantation more powerful. That is to say, if the &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;magic index&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; is &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;aa&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, the power of incantation &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;aaaa&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; is 2(&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;aa&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;+&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;aa&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;), not 1(&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;a&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;+&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;aa&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;+&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;a&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;) or 3.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is an integer t (t&lt;=30), the number of test cases.
