One day, they invent a game which has rules below:<br><strong>1. </strong>  Firstly, Alice and Bob choose some random positive integers, and here we describe them as n, d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>,..., d<sub>m</sub>.<br><strong>2. </strong>  Then they begin to write numbers alternately. At the first step, Alice has to write a &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;0&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, here we let s<sub>1</sub> = 0 ; Then, at the second step, Bob has to write a number s<sub>2</sub> which satisfies the condition that s<sub>2</sub> = s<sub>1</sub> + d<sub>k</sub> and s<sub>2</sub> &lt;= n, 1&lt;= k &lt;= m ; From the third step, the person who has to write a number in this step must write a number s<sub>i</sub> which satisfies the condition that s<sub>i</sub> = s<sub>i-1</sub> + d<sub>k</sub> or s<sub>i</sub> = s<sub>i-1</sub> - d<sub>k</sub> , and s<sub>i-2</sub> &lt; s<sub>i</sub> &lt;= n, 1 &lt;= k &lt;= m, i &gt;= 3 at the same time.<br><strong>3. </strong>  The person who can&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t write a legal number at his own step firstly lose the game.<br>Here&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s the question, please tell me who will win the game if both Alice and Bob play the game optimally.
