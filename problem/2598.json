The first line is the size of the Power Square n. You may assume n&lt;=100. The second line contains the n2 values in the Power Square, separated by spaces. Values start from the top left corner and move from left to right, moving down one row to the leftmost position when a row is filled.<br>Following the Power Square description are a number of commands, with each command on a separate line.
