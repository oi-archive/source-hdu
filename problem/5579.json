And they just invented a new game when doing their math homework.<br><br>First of all, they write three arrays $A$, $B$, and $C$, each with $N$ numbers. Then on the black board, they write those arrays as<br><br>$$A + B = C$$<br><br>If the equation is satisfied, it means for each position $i$ from $1$ to $N$, there are $A_i + B_i = C_i$ holds.<br><br>Of course, this equation is not always satisfied at the very beginning.<br><br>Fortunately, for arrays $A$, $B$ and $C$, some numbers are $changeable$, while other&apos;s are not. Those $changeable$ numbers&apos; positions are determined before the game begins.<br><br>During the game, Tweek and Craig will take turns, trying to change a number from an array. Tweek plays first.<br><br>In each turn, the player can choose a $changeable$ number from an array, and substract it by one. However, no negative numbers should appear, so the chosen number cannot be $0$ before substraction.<br><br>Tweek&apos;s goal is to make the equation satisfied during the game, while Craig&apos;s goal is to prevent it to happen.<br><br>The game ends when the equation is satisfied (a win for Tweek) or there are no possible moves but still $A + B \\neq C$ (means there is <b>at least one</b> $i \\in \\left[1, N\\right]$, where $A_i + B_i \\neq C_i$, which is a win for Craig).<br><br>Given $A$, $B$ and $C$, and the position of $changeable$ numbers for each array, your task is to determine the winner.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"First line contains an integer $T$, which indicates the number of test cases.<br><br>Every test case begins with an integers $N$, which is the length of array $A$, $B$ and $C$.<br><br>The $2^{nd}$ line and $3^{rd}$ line describe the array $A$.
