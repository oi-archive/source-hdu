So easy to paint every vertex one by one, so she is not willing to choose this way. She comes up with two ways to paint.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;1: Choose two vertexes, then there will be only one shortest path between them, she reverses the color of every vertex on the path (black to white, white to black, including the two vertexes), no two paths can overlap each other;<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;2: Choose a subtree, reverse the color of all the vertexes on the subtree.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;If it costs 1 second to finish any operate, she wants to know at least how long it will take to paint the tree into only one color.
