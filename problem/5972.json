Generally, use the shape as follows:<br>(0|9|7) (5|6) (2) (4|5)<br>Above regular expression matches 4 digits:The first is one of 0,9 and 7. The second is one of 5 and 6. The third is 2. And the fourth is one of 4 and 5. The above regular expression can be successfully matched to 0525, but it cannot be matched to 9634.<br>Now,giving you a regular expression like the above formula,and a long string of numbers,please find out all the substrings of this long string that can be matched to the regular expression.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"It contains a set of test data.The first line is a positive integer N (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 1000),on behalf of the regular representation of the N bit string.In the next N lines,the first integer of the i-th line is $a_i(1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;a_i&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 10)$,representing that the i-th position of regular expression has $a_i$ numbers to be selected.Next there are $a_i$ numeric characters.
