Highway is a straight line and there are n construction teams working at some points on it.<br>During last days the threat of a nuclear attack from Edgeland has significantly increased. Therefore the construction office has decided to develop an evacuation plan for the construction teams in case of a nuclear attack. There are m shelters located near the constructed highway. This evacuation plan must assign each team to a shelter that it should use in case of an attack.<br>Each shelter entrance must be securely locked from the inside to prevent any damage to the shelter itself. So, for each shelter there must be some team that goes to this shelter in case of an attack. The office must also supply fuel to each team, so that it can drive to its assigned shelter in case of an attack. The amount of fuel that is needed is proportional to the distance from the team&apos;s location to the assigned shelter. To minimize evacuation costs, the office would like to create a plan that minimizes the total fuel needed.<br>Your task is to help them develop such a plan.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input begins with an integer T.
