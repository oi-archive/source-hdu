They describe it as a square of length $4095$. Now they want to build their private manors. Each theoretical scientist with his wife (for example, the $i$-th couple) select $m$ fixed positions in the square, denoted by $(x_{i1},y_{i1}),(x_{i2},y_{i2}),\\cdots,(x_{im},y_{im})$, to put their own flags. We have known that the gravity centres of flags for two different theoretical scientists are distinct.<br><br>For every inch of land in this square, the influence of the $i$-th theoretical scientists and his wife, denoted by $I_i((x,y))$, is defined as<br>$$I_i((x,y)) = \\{\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{j=1}^m ((x-x_{ij})^2 + (y-y_{ij})^2)\\}^{-1}.$$<br>The couple with the highest influence has the ownership. Your mission is to compute the areas of each private manors.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases.
