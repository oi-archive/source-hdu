XM concentration come from location based services, meaning that areas with a lot of foot traffic have higher amounts versus places that don&apos;t.<br>You can collect XM by moving through those areas.<br>The XM will be automatically harvested by your Scanner when it is within your interaction circle/range.<br><br>Alice decides to select a location such that she can collect XM as much as possible.<br>To simplify the problem, we consider the city as a grid map with size `n*m&apos; numbered from $(0,0)$ to $(n-1,m-1)$.<br>The XM concentration inside the block $(i,j)$ is $p(i,j)$.<br>The radius of your interaction circle is $r$.<br>We can assume that XM of the block $(i,j)$ are located in the centre of this block.<br>The distance between two blocks is the Euclidean distance between their centres.<br><br>Alice stands in the centre of one block and collects the XM.<br>For each block with the distance d smaller than r to Alice, and whose XM concertation is $p(i,j)$, Alice&apos;s scanner can collects $p(i,j)/(1+d)$ XM from it.<br><br>Help Alice to determine the maximum XM which she can collect once he stands in the centre of one block.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple cases.<br>For each case, the first line consists two integers $n, m~(1\\le n,m \\le 500)$ and one float-point number $r~(0\\le r \\le 300)$.<br>Each of the following $n$ line consists $m$ non-negative float-point numbers corresponding to the XM concentrations inside each blocks.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each case, output the maximum XM which Alice can collect in one line.<br>Your answers should be rounded to three decimal places.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3 3 1\n1 3 6\n7 9 4\n2 8 1\n3 3 2\n1 3 6\n7 9 4\n2 8 1\n5 5 1.5\n4 3 2 9 1 \n3 4 3 2 8\n9 4 3 2 1\n2 3 0 1 2\n6 3 4 3 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">9.000\n24.142\n17.956</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2016+ACM%2FICPC+Asia+Regional+Qingdao+Online&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2016 ACM/ICPC Asia Regional Qingdao Online </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
