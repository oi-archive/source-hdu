The device is very powerful. The device can generate a hyperspace. In the hyperspace, particle may appear and disappear randomly. At the same time a great amount of energy was generated.<br>However, the device is in test phase, often in a unstable state. Mr.Smith worried that it may cause an explosion while testing it. The energy of the device is related to the maximum manhattan distance among particle.<br>Particles may appear and disappear any time. Mr.Smith wants to know the maxmium manhattan distance among particles when particle appears or disappears.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases, terminated by EOF.<br>In each case: In the first line, there are two integer q(number of particle appear and disappear event, &#x2264;60000) and k(dimensions of the hyperspace that the hyperspace the device generated, &#x2264;5). Then follows q lines. In each line, the first integer &#x2018;od&#x2019; represents the event: od = 0 means this is an appear<br>event. Then follows k integer(with absolute value less then 4 &#xD7; 10<sup>7</sup>). od = 1 means this is an disappear event. Follows a integer p represents the disappeared particle appeared in the pth event.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"Each test case should contains q lines.
