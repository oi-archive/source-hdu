You have to plan a route to deliver a newspaper to every address - and you also want to get to class right after you&apos;re done.<br>Conveniently, there are only N roads in your area connecting the addresses, and each of them takes a known time to traverse.<br>Also, you&apos;ve precalculated the time it takes to get to Waterloo campus from each address, including the newspaper office (through some combination of biking, busing, or hitching a ride).<br>How soon can you be done delivering papers and be in your seat at school?<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input consists of a number of cases, for each case:<br>First, there will be a single integer N (the number of addresses, 1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 100,000).<br>Next, there will be N+1 lines, each with an integer c<sub>i</sub> (starting with i = 0, 0 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; c<sub>i</sub> &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 1,000,000,000), the time it takes to get from location i to campus.<br>Finally, the input will contain N lines, each with three integers a, b, c (0 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; a, b &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N, a != b, 0 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; c &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 1,000). Each of these lines describes a road between locations a and b taking c minutes to traverse.<br>It is guaranteed that you will be able to reach all the addresses.
