Every day he will take part in a company&apos;s interview to get more offers. You know, everyone wants to succeed in every interview but it&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s not so easy, you must satisfy some requirements.<br> For example: Google: algorithm(100) &amp;&amp; C++(100). That means the ability of algorithm must not less than 100, the same to C++. And some skills can replace each other. For example: If C++ and Java can replace each other, than algorithm and Java larger or equal than 100 also satisfy the requisition of Google. Meanwhile, yifenfei will make progress in some skills after each interview. For example: algorithm(10) &amp;&amp; C++(10). That means after an interview, the ability of algorithm will increase 10 and the ability of C++ will increase 10.<br>Before the first interview, yifenfei can choose one skill and let the ability of this skill reach D degree, the others are 0.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer T (1&lt;=T&lt;=100) which means the number of test cases. <br>For each case:<br>First line two integers N, D.
