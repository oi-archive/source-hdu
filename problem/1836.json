The next lines describe the T test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integer numbers, separated by one blank:  the number N of vertices of the convex polygon (3 &lt;= N &lt;= 10) and the number M of straight lines (0 &lt;= M &lt;= 10). The next N lines contain 2 integer numbers X and Y, denoting the coordinates of some vertex of the polygon. The vertices are given in clockwise or anti-clockwise order.  Each of the next M lines contains 4 integer numbers: x<sub>1</sub> y<sub>1</sub> x<sub>2</sub> y<sub>2</sub>. (x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>) are two different points on the straight line.
