Now he gets into feng5166&apos;s castle. The castle is a large labyrinth. To make the problem simply, we assume the labyrinth is a N*M two-dimensional array which left-top corner is (0,0) and right-bottom corner is (N-1,M-1). Ignatius enters at (0,0), and the door to feng5166&apos;s room is at (N-1,M-1), that is our target. There are some monsters in the castle, if Ignatius meet them, he has to kill them. Here is some rules:<br><br>1.Ignatius can only move in four directions(up, down, left, right), one step per second. A step is defined as follow: if current position is (x,y), after a step, Ignatius can only stand on (x-1,y), (x+1,y), (x,y-1) or (x,y+1).<br>2.The array is marked with some characters and numbers. We define them like this:<br> . : The place where Ignatius can walk on.<br> X : The place is a trap, Ignatius should not walk on it.<br> n : Here is a monster with n HP(1&lt;=n&lt;=9), if Ignatius walk on it, it takes him n seconds to kill the monster.<br><br>Your task is to give out the path which costs minimum seconds for Ignatius to reach target position. You may assume that the start position and the target position will never be a trap, and there will never be a monster at the start position.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases. Each test case starts with a line contains two numbers N and M(2&lt;=N&lt;=100,2&lt;=M&lt;=100) which indicate the size of the labyrinth.
