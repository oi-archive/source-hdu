Until now, the most powerful computer he ever used has been a pocket calculator. Now, looking at his new computer, he is a bit disappointed, because he liked the LC-display of his calculator so much. So you decide to write a program that displays numbers in an LC-display-like style on his computer. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several lines, one for each number to be displayed. Each line contains two integers s, n (1 &lt;= s &lt;= 10, 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 99 999 999), where n is the number to be displayed and s is the size in which it shall be displayed. <br><br>The input file will be terminated by a line containing two zeros.
