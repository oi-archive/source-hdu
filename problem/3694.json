It is so named because this problem is first raised by Fermat in a private letter. In the following picture, P<sub>0</sub> is the Fermat point. You may have already known the property that:<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/3694-1.jpg\"></center> <br>Alice and Bob are learning geometry. Recently they are studying about the Fermat Point. <br><br>Alice: I wonder whether there is a similar point for quadrangle.<br><br>Bob: I think there must exist one.<br><br>Alice: Then how to know where it is? How to prove?<br><br>Bob: I don&#x2019;t know. Wait&#x2026; the point may hold the similar property as the case in triangle. <br><br>Alice: It sounds reasonable. Why not use our computer to solve the problem? Find the Fermat point, and then verify your assumption.<br><br>Bob: A good idea.<br><br>So they ask you, the best programmer, to solve it. Find the Fermat point for a quadrangle, i.e. find a point such that the total distance from the four vertices of the quadrangle to that point is the minimum.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains no more than 1000 test cases.<br><br>Each test case is a single line which contains eight float numbers, and it is formatted as below:<br><br>x<sub>1</sub> y<sub>1</sub> x<sub>2</sub> y<sub>2</sub> x<sub>3</sub> y<sub>3</sub> x<sub>4</sub> y<sub>4</sub><br><br>x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub> are the x- and y-coordinates of the ith vertices of a quadrangle.
