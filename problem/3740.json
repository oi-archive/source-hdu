It even shows up inside other words, such as &quot;other&quot; and &quot;mathematics&quot;. Sometimes it hides, split between two words, such as &quot;not here&quot;. Have you ever wondered what the most common words of lengths other than three are? <br>Your task is the following. You will be given a text. In this text, find the most common word of length one. If there are multiple such words, any one will do. Then count how many times this most common word appears in the text. If it appears more than once, output how many times it appears. Then repeat the process with words of length 2, 3, and so on, until you reach such a length that there is no longer any repeated word of that length in the text. <br><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of a sequence of lines.
