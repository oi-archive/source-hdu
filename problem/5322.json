These differ from combinations, which are selections of some members of a set where order is disregarded. For example, written as tuples, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely: (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). These are all the possible orderings of this three element set. As another example, an anagram of a word, all of whose letters are different, is a permutation of its letters. In this example, the letters are already ordered in the original word and the anagram is a reordering of the letters. <br>There is a permutation $A_{1}, A_{2}, ...A_{n}$, now we define its value as below:<br>For each $A_{i}$, if there exists a minimum $j$ satisfies $j&gt;i$ and $A_{j}&gt;A_{i}$ , then connect an edge between $A_{i}$ and $A_{j}$ , so after we connect all the edges, there is a graph G, calculate the product of the number of nodes in each component as an integer P. The permutation  value is P * P.Now, Mr. Zstu wants to know the sum of all the permutation value of n. In case the answer is very big, please output the answer mod 998244353.<br>Just in case some of you can&#x2019;t understand, all the permutations of 3 are<br>1 2 3<br>1 3 2<br>2 3 1<br>2 1 3<br>3 1 2<br>3 2 1<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.<br>There are no more than 10000 test cases.<br>Each test case is an integer n$(1 \\leq n \\leq 100000)$.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output the answer as described above.<br><br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n5</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"ZSTU","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2015+Multi-University+Training+Contest+3&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2015 Multi-University Training Contest 3 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
