Yuta is worrying about this situation, so he gives Rikka some math tasks to practice. There is one of them:<br><br>For an undirected graph $G$ with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, we can define the distance between $(i,j)$ ($\\text{dist}(i,j)$) as the length of the shortest path between $i$ and $j$. The length of a path is equal to the number of the edges on it. Specially, if there are no path between $i$ and $j$, we make $\\text{dist}(i,j)$ equal to $n$.<br><br>Then, we can define the weight of the graph $G$ ($w_G$) as $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\text{dist}(i,j)$.<br><br>Now, Yuta has $n$ nodes, and he wants to choose no more than $m$ pairs of nodes $(i,j)(i \\neq j)$ and then link edges between each pair. In this way, he can get an undirected graph $G$ with $n$ nodes and no more than $m$ edges.<br><br>Yuta wants to know the minimal value of $w_G$.<br><br>It is too difficult for Rikka. Can you help her?&#xA0;&#xA0;<br><br>In the sample, Yuta can choose $(1,2),(1,4),(2,4),(2,3),(3,4)$.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a number $t(1 \\leq t \\leq 10)$, the number of the testcases. <br><br>For each testcase, the first line contains two numbers $n,m(1 \\leq n \\leq 10^6,1 \\leq m \\leq 10^{12})$.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each testcase, print a single line with a single number -- the answer.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n4 5</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">14</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2017+Multi-University+Training+Contest+-+Team+5&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2017 Multi-University Training Contest - Team 5 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
