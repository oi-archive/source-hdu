If the numbers are simple, like 20%, 40%, and 40%, you know that they asked 5 people (or 10, or 15, or more, but we are  interested in the minimum number of people).<br><br>Your task is to write a program that reads sets of percentages and calculates the smallest number of people that could produce the given percentages. We know that this number is always less than 10 000.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input is a set of percentages. Each set is on a line of its own. Every line starts with an integer n (0 &lt;= n &lt;= 20) giving the number of percentages in the set. If n &gt; 0, the percentages follow as n numbers; these numbers may have 0&#x2013;5 decimals, and all percentages in a set have the same number of decimals. (If there are no decimals, there is no decimal point.) The percentages always add up to about 100% as there may be small rounding errors. Numbers are rounded when digits are removed; they are rounded upwards if the first removed digit is 5 or more. Thus, 4.472 is rounded to 4.47, 4.5, or 4, depending on how many digits you want.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each set of data, print a line starting with &#x201C;Case i :&#x201D;, where &#x201C;i&#x201D; is the data set&#x2019;s number. Then follows a space and an integer giving the computed number of people.
