Each part should be completed continuously. This means if a part should take 3 days, we should use a continuous 3 days do complete it. There are four types of constrains among these parts which are FAS, FAF, SAF and SAS. A constrain between parts is FAS if the first one should finish after the second one started. FAF is finish after finish. SAF is start after finish, and SAS is start after start. Assume there are enough people involved in the projects, which means we can do any number of parts concurrently. You are to write a program to give a schedule of a given project, which has the shortest time.
