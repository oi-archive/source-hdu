Rather than line them up in increasing or  decreasing height order, he wants to line them up so each guard   is either shorter than the guards next to him or taller than the guards next to him (so the heights go up and  down along the line). For example, seven guards of heights 160, 162, 164, 166, 168, 170   and   172 cm. could be arranged as:<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C426-1006-1.jpg\"></center> <br><br>or perhaps:<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C426-1006-2.jpg\"></center> <br><br>The king wants to know how many guards he needs so he can have a   different up and down order at each changing of the guard for rest of his reign. To be able to do this, he needs to know for a given number of guards, n, how many  different up and  down orders there are:<br><br>For example, if there are four guards: 1, 2, 3,4 can be arrange   as:<br><br>1324, 2143, 3142, 2314, 3412, 4231, 4132, 2413, 3241, 1423<br><br>For this problem, you will write a program that takes as input a positive integer n, the number of guards and returns the number of up and down orders for n guards of   differing heights.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a single integer P, (1 &lt;= P &lt;= 1000), which is the number of  data sets that follow.
