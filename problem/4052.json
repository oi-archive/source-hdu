After investigation, they found that the bottleneck was at Absolutely Crowded Manufactory (ACM). In oder to accelerate the procedure, they bought a new machine for ACM. But a new problem comes, how to place the new machine into ACM? <br><br>ACM is a rectangular factor and can be divided into W * H cells. There are N retangular old machines in ACM and the new machine can not occupy any cell where there is old machines. The new machine needs M consecutive cells. Consecutive cells means some adjacent cells in a line. You are asked to calculate the number of ways to choose the place for the new machine. <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases (no more than 50).
