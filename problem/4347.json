ZLC is facing a serious problem .There are many points in K-dimensional space .Given a point. ZLC need to find out the closest m points. Euclidean distance is used as the distance metric between two points. The Euclidean distance between points p and q is the length of the line segment connecting them.In Cartesian coordinates, if p = (p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>,..., p<sub>n</sub>) and q = (q<sub>1</sub>, q<sub>2</sub>,..., q<sub>n</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance from p to q, or from q to p is given by:<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C402-1009-1.jpg\"></center><br>Can you help him solve this problem?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"In the first line of the text file .there are two non-negative integers n and K. They denote respectively: the number of points, 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 50000, and the number of Dimensions,1 &lt;= K &lt;= 5. In each of the following n lines there is written k integers, representing the coordinates of a point. This followed by a line with one positive integer t, representing the number of queries,1 &lt;= t &lt;=10000.each query contains two lines. The k integers in the first line represent the given point. In the second line, there is one integer m, the number of closest points you should find,1 &lt;= m &lt;=10. The absolute value of all the coordinates will not be more than 10000.<br>There are multiple test cases.
