The initial graph has 3n - 2 edges connecting all pairs of adjacent nodes.<br>You need to maintain the graph with two types of different adjustments. The first one, denoted by &#x201C;1 $x_0$ $y_0$  $x_1$  $y_1$&#x201D;,adds an new edge between the nodes ($x_0, y_0$) and ($x_1, y_1$) which was not exist. The second one, denoted by&#x201C;2 $x_0$ $y_0$ $x_1$ $y_1$&#x201D;, erases an existed edge between the nodes ($x_0, y_0$) and ($x_1, y_1$).<br>It is sure that, for each adjustment, ($x_0, y_0$) and ($x_1, y_1$) were adjacent in the original grid graph. That is say thateither they share the same x coordinate and |$y_0 - y_1$| = 1, or they share the same y coordinate and |$x_0 - x_1$| = 1.<br>After each adjustment, we guarantee the connectedness of the graph and you need to calculate the number of bridges in the current graph.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains an integer T (1 &#x2264; T &#x2264; 1001) which is the total number of test cases.
