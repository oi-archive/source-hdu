He thinks that only the increasing sequence is harmony, so he wants to change the sequence into a harmony one. But the only operation he can use is: Choosing a contiguous subsequence {A[i], A[i + 1]...A[j]} and do a random shuffling on it. (Random shuffle means that every permutation will appear with equal possibility)<br>So, what&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s the expected number of operations when using the best strategy?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists several testcases.<br>First line, an integer N (0 &lt; N &lt;= 50) denoting the length of this array.<br>In the next line there are N integers, representing a permutation.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Print one line with the expectation.<br>The result should be given with absolute or relative error of at most 10<sup>-6</sup>.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5\n2 1 3 5 4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4.0000000000</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2011+Alibaba-Cup+Campus+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2011 Alibaba-Cup Campus Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
