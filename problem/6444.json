If she stands at $i-th$ grid, she will get $a_{i}$ happy value, and she can spend one unit energy to go to $((i + k) \\bmod n)-th$ grid. If she has already visited this grid, she can get happy value again. Neko can choose jump to next grid if she has energy or end at anywhere. <br>Neko has $m$ unit energies and she wants to achieve at least $s$ happy value.<br>How much happy value does she need at least before she jumps so that she can get at least $s$ happy value? Please note that the happy value which neko has is a non-negative number initially, but it can become negative number when jumping.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains only one integer $T ( T \\leq 50)$, which indicates the number of test cases.   <br>For each test case, the first line contains four integers $n, s, m, k(1 \\leq n \\leq 10^4, 1 \\leq s \\leq 10^{18}, 1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq k \\leq n)$.<br>The next line contains $n$ integers, the $i-th$ integer is $a_{i-1}(-10^9 \\leq a_{i-1} \\leq 10^9)$<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one line &quot;Case #x: y&quot;, where x is the case number (starting from 1) and y is the answer.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n3 10 5 2\n3 2 1\n5 20 6 3\n2 3 2 1 5</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 0\nCase #2: 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2018%D6%D0%B9%FA%B4%F3%D1%A7%C9%FA%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%BE%BA%C8%FC+-+%CD%F8%C2%E7%D1%A1%B0%CE%C8%FC&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2018&#x4E2D;&#x56FD;&#x5927;&#x5B66;&#x751F;&#x7A0B;&#x5E8F;&#x8BBE;&#x8BA1;&#x7ADE;&#x8D5B; - &#x7F51;&#x7EDC;&#x9009;&#x62D4;&#x8D5B; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
