You are lucky enough to have a chance to have a tour in the kingdom. The route should be designed as: The route should contain one or more loops. (A loop is a route like: A-&gt;B-&gt;&#x2026;&#x2026;-&gt;P-&gt;A.)<br>Every city should be just in one route.<br>A loop should have at least two cities. In one route, each city should be visited just once. (The only exception is that the first and the last city should be the same and this city is visited twice.)<br>The total distance the N roads you have chosen should be minimized.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"An integer T in the first line indicates the number of the test cases.<br>In each test case, the first line contains two integers N and M, indicating the number of the cities and the one-way roads.
