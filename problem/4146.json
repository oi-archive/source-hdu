One side of each piece is white and the other one is black and each piece is lying either it&apos;s black or white side up. The rows are numbered with integers from 1 to N upside down; the columns are numbered with integers from 1 to N from the left to the right. Sequences of commands (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) are given from input, which means that both pieces in row x<sub>i</sub> and pieces in column y<sub>i</sub> will be flipped (Note that piece (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) will be flipped twice here). Can you tell me how many white pieces after sequences of commands?<br>Consider the following 4*4 field as an example:<br><br>bwww<br>wbww<br>wwbw<br>wwwb<br><br>Here &quot;b&quot; denotes pieces lying their black side up and &quot;w&quot; denotes pieces lying their white side up.<br>Two commands are given in order: (1, 1), (4, 4). Then we can get the final 4*4 field as follows:<br><br>bbbw<br>bbwb<br>bwbb<br>wbbb<br><br>So the answer is 4 as there are 4 white pieces in the final field.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a positive integer T, indicating the number of test cases (1 &lt;= T &lt;= 20).<br>For each case, the first line contains a positive integer N, indicating the size of field; The following N lines contain N characters each which represent the initial field.
