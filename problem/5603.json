For Convenience, we make $1 \\leq P_1 &lt; P_2 &lt; ...... &lt; P_{k_i} \\leq 10^{6}$<br><br>we can also know the total number of points in all groups is no more than $3*10^5$<br>now the problem is that for each group, we want to know the total number of the segments, which include at least one given point in this group.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Multiple cases of data (no more than 30 cases)<br><br>For each case, the first line contains two integers N and M, respectively, indicating the number of segments and M group.<br><br>The next N lines, each line contains two integers$L_i$ and $R_i$, represents the start and end positions of ith segment.<br><br><br>The next M lines, each line describes a group.
