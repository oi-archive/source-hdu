The i -th bit counting from left is transmitted at time i  (e.g. 4-bit unsigned integer 5 is transmitted in this order: 0-1-0-1). The network delay is modeled as follows: if a bit is transmitted at time i , it may arrive at as early as i + 1  and as late is i + d + 1 , where d  represents the maximal network delay. If more than one bit arrived at the same time, they could be received in any order.<br><br>For example, if you&apos;re transmitting a 3-bit unsigned integer 2 (010) for d = 1 , you may receive 010, 100 (first bit is delayed) or 001 (second bit is delayed).<br><br>Write a program to find the number of different integers that could be received, and the smallest/largest ones among them.
