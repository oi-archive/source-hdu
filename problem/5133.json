One day, when you were skimming through your records of experiments, you find that the squared frequency, defined as (P/Q)<sup>2</sup>, in which Q indicates times of experiments and P means number of experiments in which the expected phenomenon appears, is somehow unreasonable. The squared frequency F (0 &lt; F &lt; 1) is written in decimal form, and rounded to K (K &#x2264; 9) numbers after the decimal point. You think that Q, i.e. times of experiments, is too small to obtain such a number. Now you need to work out a fraction P/Q, so that rounding (P/Q)<sup>2</sup> to K numbers after the decimal point gets exactly F, and minimizes Q.
