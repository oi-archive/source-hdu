In his backyard, there are three apple trees with coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_3, y_3)$. Now Taotao is planning to plant a new one, but he is not willing to take these trees too close. He believes that the new apple tree should be outside the circle which the three apple trees that already exist is on. Taotao picked a potential position $(x,y)$ of the new tree.
