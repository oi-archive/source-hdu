It is constructed with 15 sliding tiles, each with a number from 1 to 15 on it, and all packed into a 4 by 4 frame with one tile missing. Let&apos;s call the missing tile &apos;x&apos;; the object of the puzzle is to arrange the tiles so that they are ordered as: <br><pre><br> 1  2  3  4<br> 5  6  7  8<br> 9 10 11 12<br>13 14 15  x<br></pre><br>where the only legal operation is to exchange &apos;x&apos; with one of the tiles with which it shares an edge. As an example, the following sequence of moves solves a slightly scrambled puzzle: <br><pre><br> 1  2  3  4     1  2  3  4     1  2  3  4     1  2  3  4<br> 5  6  7  8     5  6  7  8     5  6  7  8     5  6  7  8<br> 9  x 10 12     9 10  x 12     9 10 11 12     9 10 11 12<br>13 14 11 15    13 14 11 15    13 14  x 15    13 14 15  x<br>            r-&gt;            d-&gt;            r-&gt;<br></pre><br>The letters in the previous row indicate which neighbor of the &apos;x&apos; tile is swapped with the &apos;x&apos; tile at each step; legal values are &apos;r&apos;,&apos;l&apos;,&apos;u&apos; and &apos;d&apos;, for right, left, up, and down, respectively. <br><br>Not all puzzles can be solved; in 1870, a man named Sam Loyd was famous for distributing an unsolvable version of the puzzle, and <br>frustrating many people. In fact, all you have to do to make a regular puzzle into an unsolvable one is to swap two tiles (not counting the missing &apos;x&apos; tile, of course). <br><br>In this problem, you will write a program for solving the less well-known 8-puzzle, composed of tiles on a three by three <br>arrangement.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"You will receive, several descriptions of configuration of the 8 puzzle.

For example, this puzzle <br><br> 1  2  3 <br> x  4  6 <br> 7  5  8 <br><br>is described by this list: <br><br>1 2 3 x 4 6 7 5 8<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"You will print to standard output either the word ``unsolvable&apos;&apos;, if the puzzle has no solution, or a string consisting entirely of the letters &apos;r&apos;, &apos;l&apos;, &apos;u&apos; and &apos;d&apos; that describes a series of moves that produce a solution.
