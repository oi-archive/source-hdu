Given an undirected graph, you are to find out a subgraph of it so that the degree of the i-th node in the subgraph is the given integer D<sub>i</sub>. The subgraph is a subset of edges and all vertexes are reserved. Notice that the graph may be disconnected, and two edges may connect the same vertexes, but no self cyclic exists.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases, the first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.<br>For each test case, the first line contains two integers N and M, denoting the number of vertexes and number of edges in the graph. (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 50, 1 &lt;= M &lt;= 200)<br>For the next M lines, each line contains two integers X and Y, denote there is a edge between X-th node and Y-th node. (1 &lt;= X, Y &lt;= N)<br>For the last N lines, each line contains a single integer D<sub>i</sub>, denote the degree of i-th node in the subgraph.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, if the subgraph exist, output &quot;YES&quot;, otherwise output &quot;NO&quot;.
