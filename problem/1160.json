To disprove this, you want to take the data on a collection of mice and put as large a subset of this data as possible into a sequence so that the weights are increasing, but the speeds are decreasing.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input contains data for a bunch of mice, one mouse per line, terminated by end of file.<br><br>The data for a particular mouse will consist of a pair of integers: the first representing its size in grams and the second representing its speed in centimeters per second. Both integers are between 1 and 10000. The data in each test case will contain information for at most 1000 mice.<br><br>Two mice may have the same weight, the same speed, or even the same weight and speed. <br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Your program should output a sequence of lines of data; the first line should contain a number n; the remaining n lines should each contain a single positive integer (each one representing a mouse). If these n integers are m[1], m[2],..., m[n] then it must be the case that <br><br>   W[m[1]] &lt; W[m[2]] &lt; ... &lt; W[m[n]]<br><br>and <br><br>   S[m[1]] &gt; S[m[2]] &gt; ... &gt; S[m[n]]<br><br>In order for the answer to be correct, n should be as large as possible.<br>All inequalities are strict: weights must be strictly increasing, and speeds must be strictly decreasing. There may be many correct outputs for a given input, your program only needs to find one. <br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">6008 1300\n6000 2100\n500 2000\n1000 4000\n1100 3000\n6000 2000\n8000 1400\n6000 1200\n2000 1900</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4\n4\n5\n9\n7</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=Zhejiang+University+Training+Contest+2001&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> Zhejiang University Training Contest 2001 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
