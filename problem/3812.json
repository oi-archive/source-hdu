What a wonderful scene it would be, connecting the two charming scenery. But iSea cannot ask help from God, or some other deities in China. The only mean he can use is imagination.<br><br>For example, from sea, he can associate with love, from love, he can see sky in (strange logic, aha? leave him alone, we don&apos;t really care how he imagine since he is so weird). In this way, he connects &quot;Sea&quot; and &quot;Sky&quot; in mind, fulfills his goal.<br>However, he can only solve the puzzle with small number of words, when the connection increases, his brain will come to be a total mess. Now, can you smart guys help him?<br><br>Now iSea gives you some word pairs he can associate, from any one of them to another. He wishes use the maximum word to make an association list, from &#x201C;sea&#x201D; to &#x201C;sky&#x201D;, of course, no word should appear in the list twice because it would lead to an infinite loop. Your task is to find a list, which contains the maximum word and every neighbor word can be connected in mind. If several solutions exist, find the lexicographically minimum one.<br>Lexicographical sequence is the order in one dictionary. For example, &#x201C;cat&#x201D; is less than &#x201C;do&#x201D;, and &#x201C;do&#x201D; is less than &#x201C;dog&#x201D;.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer T, indicating the number of test cases.<br>Each test case begins with an integer N, then N lines follow, each line contains two words can be connected in mind.<br><br>Technical Specification<br><br>1. 1 &lt;= T &lt;= 50<br>2. 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100<br>3.
