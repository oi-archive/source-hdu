This is called the &#x2018;block length sequence (BLS)&#x2019; for that string. For example, the BLS for 011100110100011 is 3, 2, 1, 2.<br><br>Similarly, given a 01 matrix, you can write down the BLS for each row and each column. Given these BLS&#x2019;s, your task is to restore the 01 matrix.<br><br><b>Rows are read from left to right, while columns are read from top to bottom.</b> Each test case is guaranteed to be solvable, and you&#x2019;re free to output any (but only one!) solution you like.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains at most 10 test cases.

The next n lines contain the BLS&#x2019;s for each row, from top to bottom, and the next m lines contains the BLS&#x2019;s for each column, from left to right. Each BLS ends with zero.
