One day, he feels very boring and writes some expressions randomly. Later, he discovers that although some expressions were written in different forms, they are essentially the same, such as a+(b-c), (a+b)-c. After several attempts, he becomes interested in this and wants to know the number of distinct expressions involving n different operands.<br><br>To make the problem easier, you can assume that only operators +, -, *, / and parentheses are permitted.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of multiple test cases.<br><br>For each test case, there is one line containing only one integer n.
