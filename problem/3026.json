Now, let&apos;s consider a game which is similar to it. There is a N * M chess board, we hope we can put rooks as more as possible. But just a certain number of postions can be put rooks on. One rook can attack another if they are in the same row or column. Now you may think this is a very simple problem for you. But as very whuacmers know, winnie is evil enough to cheat you. Let&apos;s consider some positions called critical postions. If we don&apos;t put rook on the critical position, the maximum number of rook we can put on this chess board will reduce. How many critical positions on the chess board?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Input will contain multiple test cases. The first line contains three numbers N, M, K(N, M &#x2264; 10000, K &#x2264; 100000) which indicate height, width and number of positions which can be put rook on. Then next K lines follow, each contains two integer X ans Y which indicate we can put rook on the Xth row, Yth column.
