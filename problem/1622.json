Current state-of-the art parallel computers such as Thinking Machines&apos; CM-5 are based on fat trees. Quad- and octal-trees are fundamental to many algorithms in computer graphics. <br><br>This problem involves building and traversing binary trees. <br>Given a sequence of binary trees, you are to write a program that prints a level-order traversal of each tree. In this problem each node of a binary tree contains a positive integer and all binary trees have have fewer than 256 nodes. <br><br>In a level-order traversal of a tree, the data in all nodes at a given level are printed in left-to-right order and all nodes at level k are printed before all nodes at level k+1. <br><br>For example, a level order traversal of the tree <br><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1622-1.gif\"><br>is: 5, 4, 8, 11, 13, 4, 7, 2, 1. <br><br>In this problem a binary tree is specified by a sequence of pairs (n,s) where n is the value at the node whose path from the root is given by the string s. A path is given be a sequence of L&apos;s and R&apos;s where L indicates a left branch and R indicates a right branch. In the tree diagrammed above, the node containing 13 is specified by (13,RL), and the node containing 2 is specified by (2,LLR). The root node is specified by (5,) where the empty string indicates the path from the root to itself. A binary tree is considered to be completely specified if every node on all root-to-node paths in the tree is given a value exactly once. <br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input is a sequence of binary trees specified as described above. Each tree in a sequence consists of several pairs (n,s) as described above separated by whitespace. The last entry in each tree is ().
