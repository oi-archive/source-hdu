The devil always asks the king to do some crazy things. Although the king used to be wise and beloved by his people.

When the devil hears about that, she decided to take some action.<br><br>   But before that, there is another party arose recently, the &apos;MengMengDa&apos; party, everyone in this party feel everything is &apos;MengMengDa&apos; and acts like a &apos;MengMengDa&apos; guy.<br><br>   While they are very pleased about that, it brings many people in this kingdom troubles.

You can choose two set S(a_s1,a_s2,..,a_sk) and T(a_t1,a_t2,...,a_tm). Each element in S should be at the left of every element in T.(si &lt; tj for all i,j). S and T shouldn&apos;t be empty.<br><br>   And what we want is the bitwise XOR of each element in S is equal to the bitwise AND of each element in T.<br><br>   How many ways are there to choose such two sets? You should output the result modulo 10^9+7.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"   The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of the test cases.<br>   For each test case, the first line contains a integers n.<br>   The next line contains n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n which are separated by a single space.<br><br>   <b>n&lt;=10^3, 0 &lt;= a_i &lt;1024, T&lt;=20.</b>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"   For each test case, output the result in one line.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n1 2 3 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1 \n4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Author","content":"WJMZBMR","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2014+Multi-University+Training+Contest+4&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2014 Multi-University Training Contest 4 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
