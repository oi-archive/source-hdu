A thinks of a number x between a and b randomly in his mind, and he lets B to guess this number. A will say too small if B&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s guess is less than x and A will say yes if B&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s guess is just x.Once B&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;sguess is bigger than x,A won&apos;t speak any more.After that,A just nods his head if B&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s guess is just x,otherwise shakes his head.The problem is that how many kinds of best guess strategies to make the least number of guesses in the worst situation?<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input contains multiple sets of test data and each of them occupies one line,including two integersa, b(1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;a&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;b&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;5 * 10^6),on behalf of range of the number.Input to the end of the file.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each set of input, output one line containing two integers.
