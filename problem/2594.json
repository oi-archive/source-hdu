I want to find out if I have a talent in politics, OK?<br>Marge: OK.<br>Homer: So I take some politician&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s name, say Clinton, and try to find the length of the longest prefix<br>in Clinton&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s name that is a suffix in my name. That&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s how close I am to being a politician like Clinton<br>Marge: Why on earth choose the longest prefix that is a suffix???<br>Homer: Well, our talents are deeply hidden within ourselves, Marge.<br>Marge: So how close are you?<br>Homer: 0!<br>Marge: I&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;m not surprised.<br>Homer: But you know, you must have some real math talent hidden deep in you.<br>Marge: How come?<br>Homer: Riemann and Marjorie gives 3!!!<br>Marge: Who the heck is Riemann?<br>Homer: Never mind.<br>Write a program that, when given strings s1 and s2, finds the longest prefix of s1 that is a suffix of s2.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input consists of two lines.
