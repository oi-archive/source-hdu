He defined a relation called $\\textit{k-similarity}$ between two $\\textbf{nonempty}$ strings.<br><br>The definition of $k$-similarity is shown below:<br>1. for nonempty string $S$, $S$ and $S$ are $k$-similar;<br>2. for two nonempty strings $S$ and $T$ with $|S| + |T| \\leq k$, if $S \\circ T$ and $T \\circ S$ are $k$-similar ($\\circ$ denotes string concatenation), then $S$ and $T$ are $k$-similar;<br>3. if $S$ and $T$ are $k$-similar, then $P \\circ S \\circ Q$ and $P \\circ T \\circ Q$ are $k$-similar, where $P$ and $Q$ are arbitrary (possibly empty) strings;<br>4. if $S$ and $U$ are $k$-similar, $U$ and $T$ are $k$-similar, then $S$ and $T$ are $k$-similar.<br><br>For example, $\\texttt{aaa}$ and $\\texttt{aaa}$ are 3-similar according to the the first condition. Hence, $\\texttt{a}$ and $\\texttt{aa}$ are 3-similar according to the second condition. Moreover, $\\texttt{ba}$ and $\\texttt{baa}$, $\\texttt{baa}$ and $\\texttt{baaa}$ are also 3-similar, respectively, according to the third condition. Finally, $\\texttt{ba}$ and $\\texttt{baaa}$ are 3-similar, according to the fourth condition.<br><br>Now, given two strings $A, B$ and an integer $k$, please determine whether $A$ and $B$ are $k$-similar.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input is a single integer $T$ $(1 \\leq T \\leq 5000)$, denoting the number of test cases.
