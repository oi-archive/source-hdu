Maybe you could have saved some money if you were a bit more clever about where you filled your fuel?<br>To help other tourists (and save money yourself next time), you want to write a program for finding the cheapest way to travel between cities, filling your tank on the way. We assume that all cars use one unit of fuel per unit of distance, and start with an empty gas tank.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input gives 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000 and 0 &lt;= m &lt;= 10000, the number of cities and roads.
