Due to immense amount of unsolicited automated programs which were crawling across their pages, they decided to put Yet-Another-Public-Turing-Test-to-Tell-Computers-and-Humans-Apart on their webpages. In short, to get access to their scientific papers, one have to prove yourself eligible and worthy, i.e. solve a mathematic riddle.<br><br><br>However, the test turned out difficult for some math PhD students and even for some professors. Therefore, the math department wants to write a helper program which solves this task (it is not irrational, as they are going to make money on selling the program).<br><br>The task that is presented to anyone visiting the start page of the math department is as follows: given a natural n, compute<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/con181-1009-1.JPG\"></center><br>where [x] denotes the largest integer not greater than x.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains the number of queries t (t &lt;= 10^6).
