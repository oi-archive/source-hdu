The conqueror of Doge Space is Super Doge, who is going to inspect his Doge Army on all Doge Planets. The inspection starts from Doge Planet 1 where DOS (Doge Olympic Statue) was built. It takes Super Doge exactly T<sub>xy</sub> time to travel from Doge Planet x to Doge Planet y.<br>   With the ambition of conquering other spaces, he would like to visit all Doge Planets as soon as possible. More specifically, he would like to visit the Doge Planet x at the time no later than Deadline<sub>x</sub>. He also wants the sum of all arrival time of each Doge Planet to be as small as possible. You can assume it takes so little time to inspect his Doge Army that we can ignore it.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   There are multiple test cases.
