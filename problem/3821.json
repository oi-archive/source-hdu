(0 based)<br>2.Graceful Matrix (GM), means in every rows and every columns, there is one and only one 1, while others are all 0.<br><br>Now we also have a graceful problem, given a GM whose size is N, you need find a BM sequence. At first, the matrix is a UM, by multiplying the matrix one by one in the BM&#x2019;s sequence order we can get the GM finally. You needn&#x2019;t find the shortest sequence, but the sequence&#x2019;s length can&#x2019;t exceed the number of elements in GM.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer T, indicating the number of test cases.<br>Each test case begins with an integer N, indicating the GM&#x2019;s size.<br>Then N lines follow, each line contains N integers, 1 or 0, indicating the GM.<br>You can assume the input Matrix is always graceful.<br><br>Technical Specification<br><br>1. 1 &lt;= T &lt;= 50<br>2. 2 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output the case number first, then the length of the sequence T your answer will give.
