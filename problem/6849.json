You can imagine the structure of the tree as an undirected tree. There are $m$ roses blossom, and Koishi wants to pick some of them. The $i$-th rose contains the node $u$ if and only if the distance from $u$ to $x_i$ is equal to or smaller than $r_i$. Additionally, the $i$-th flower&apos;s value is $v_i$.<br><br>Koishi wants to maxmize the sum of values of picked roses. However, she doesn&apos;t like broken rose, so any two of her picked roses can&apos;t intersect.
