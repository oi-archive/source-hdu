As we know, he is the god of &#x201C;Number Theory&#x201D;. He always kills the problem about &#x201C;Number Theory&#x201D; in seconds! But of course we do not have any idea about these problems~ One day in ACM_DIY, AekdyCoin asks us one problem:<br>You are given three non-negative integers A, B and K, you are expected to find how many X that satisfy.<br>X^A = B( mod (2K + 1) )<br>X is in the ranger [0, 2K]; <br><br>Of course we have no idea about this problem, so could you help us?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is one integer T indicates the number of the test cases.
