The first line of the input is a single integer T which is the number of test cases. T test cases follow.<br>Each test case starts with a line contains only one integer n (0 &lt; n &lt;= 20), indicating the number of simple series circuits. Next n lines are the descriptions of each simple series circuit. The wire is consisted by the character &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;-&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;. And resistances are show by positive integers, means their resistance values. The line&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s length is shorter than 100 characters, and the count of resistance in each simple series circuit is no more than 20.<br>I assure all the calculations by integers using in this problem will not overflow the integer.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each case, please output the resistance value of the parallel circuit.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n1\n---5----\n2\n----2----3-1----\n---2---2-------2-</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5.00\n3.00</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"possessor WC","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=HDU+2nd+%A1%B0Vegetable-Birds+Cup%A1%B1+Programming+Open+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> HDU 2nd &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Vegetable-Birds Cup&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; Programming Open Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
