Of course, the problem is not over, the initial interger sequence will change all the time. Changing format is like this [S E] (abs(E-S)&lt;=1000)  that mean between the S and E of the sequece will Rotate one times.<br>For example initial sequence is 1 2 3 4 5.<br>If changing format is [1 3], than the sequence will be 1 3 4 2 5 because the first sequence is base from 0.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains multiple test cases.<br>Each case first given a integer n standing the length of integer sequence (2&lt;=n&lt;=3000000) <br>Second a line with n integers standing F[i](0&lt;F[i]&lt;=10000)<br>Third a line with one integer m (m &lt; 10000)<br>Than m lines quiry, first give the type of quiry.
