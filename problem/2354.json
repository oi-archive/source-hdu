Instead<br>of using regular-sized bricks, the Tetrad Corporation seems overly fond of bricks made out of strange shapes. The structural integrity of a wall can be<br>approximated by the fewest number of bricks that could be removed to create a gap from the top to the bottom. Can you determine that number for<br>various odd walls created by Tetrad?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer X (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; X &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 100) indicating the number of data sets. Each data set consists of<br>two components:<br><br>A single line, &quot;M N&quot; (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; M,N &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 20) where M and N indicate the height and width (in units), respectively, of a brick wall;<br>A series of M lines, each N alphabetic characters in length. Each character will indicate to which brick that unit of the wall belongs to. Note<br>that bricks will be contiguous; each unit of a brick will be adjacent (diagonals do not count as adjacent) to another unit of that brick. Multiple<br>bricks may use the same characters for their representation, but any bricks that use identical characters will not be adjacent to each other. All<br>letters will be uppercase.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each data set, output the fewest number of bricks to remove to create a gap that leads from some point at the top of the wall, to some point at the<br>bottom of the wall. Assume that bricks are in fixed locations and do not &quot;fall&quot; if bricks are removed from beneath them. A gap consists of contiguous<br>units of removed bricks; each unit of a gap must be adjacent (diagonals do not count) to another unit of the gap.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n5 7\nAABBCCD\nEFFGGHH\nIIJJKKL\nMNNOOPP\nQQRRSST\n5 7\nAABBCCD\nAFFBGGD\nIIJBKKD\nMNNOOPD\nQQRRSST\n6 7\nABCDEAB\nABCFEAB\nAEAABAB\nACDAEEB\nFFGAHIJ\nKLMANOP</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5\n2\n2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=HDU+2008%278+%B9%AB%BF%AA%C8%FC%A3%A8%B7%C7%D4%AD%B4%B4%A3%A9&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> HDU 2008&apos;8 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x52D;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
