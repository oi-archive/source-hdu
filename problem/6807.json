We assume that every watch has two hands: the hour hand and the minute hand, both moves at a uniform speed.<br><br>Someone pointed out the problem of the watches. Then everyone began to doubt that it&apos;s a fake photo. To respond, Zhang3 will announce that the photo is taken at time $x$, which is a time in a day. By choosing $x$ perfectly, she can make all of the watches look like showing time $x$, with a small error. For example, if there are two watches showing $\\text{12:30:00}$ and $\\text{02:40:00}$ respectively, she can choose $x = \\text{01:35:00}$ as if both watches are showing time $x$.<br><br>Specifically, we define the error of a hand of a watch as the angle between its actual location and its ideal location, where the ideal location is the correct location to show time $x$. In the example above, the first watch shows $\\text{12:30:00}$ and $x = \\text{01:35:00}$, so the minute hand has an error of $30^\\circ$ while the error of the hour hand is a little bit larger.<br><br>Please help Zhang3 choose such $x$ that the maximum error among all of the $2n$ hands is minimized. $x$ doesn&apos;t need to be an integer in seconds. Print the optimal error in degrees.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input gives the number of test cases $T \\; (1 \\le T \\le 100)$. $T$ test cases follow.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains an integer $n \\; (1 \\le n \\le 5 \\times 10^4)$, the number of watches.<br><br>Then $n$ lines follow, the $i^\\mathrm{th}$ of which contains a string of format $\\text{HH:MM:SS} \\; (0 \\le \\text{HH} \\le 23, 0 \\le \\text{MM, SS} \\le 59)$, describing the time the $i^\\mathrm{th}$ watch is showing.<br><br>The sum of $n$ in all test cases doesn&apos;t exceed $10^5$.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print a line with a real number $\\alpha \\; (0 \\le \\alpha \\le 180)$, representing the answer is $\\alpha ^\\circ$.<br><br>Your answers should have absolute or relative errors of at most $10^{-6}$.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n2\n12:30:00\n02:40:00\n3\n00:00:00\n23:59:59\n06:30:30</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">32.5\n91.55</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2020+Multi-University+Training+Contest+4&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2020 Multi-University Training Contest 4 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
