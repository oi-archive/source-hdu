The apparent magnitude of a celestial body is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth, normalized to the value it would have in the absence of the atmosphere. The brighter the object appears, the lower the value of its magnitude would be.<br>In this problem, can you help me to count the stars and their average apmag in the sky?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several cases in the input, each case begin with two positive integer N (N&lt;=60,000) and M (M&lt;=20,000) giving the number of stars and queries. The following N lines give the 2D- coordinate (-10^8 &lt; x, y &lt; 10^8, integer) and the apmag (-40.00 &lt; apmag &lt; 40.00, a float number of two decimal places) of each star.
