She can kill every enemy she spots at the same time, even if they are in different positions.<br>There are some walls in a map. The locations of enemies are represented by some points and walls are represented by some line segments in the XY plane. The position of senior Pan is also described as a point. Senior Pan can spot an enemy if and only if the segment between them doesn&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t intersect with any wall segment. But if there are other enemies on this segment, she can kill all of them. <br>For some given positions, senior Pan wants to know how many enemies she can kill in these positions.
