Each city can be viewed as a point in a two- dimensional plane with integer coordinates (x,y). The distance between city i and city j is defined by d<sub>ij</sub> = |x<sub>i</sub> - x<sub>j</sub>| + |y<sub>i</sub> - y<sub>j</sub>|. jiuye want to setup airport in K cities among N cities. So he need your help to choose these K cities, to minimize the maximum distance to the nearest airport of each city. That is , if we define d<sub>i</sub>(1 &#x2264; i &#x2264; N ) as the distance from city i to the nearest city with airport. Your aim is to minimize the value max{d<sub>i</sub>|1 &#x2264; i &#x2264; N }. You just output the minimum.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The first line of the input is T (1 &#x2264; T &#x2264; 100), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.<br><br>   The first line of each case contains two integers N ,K (1 &#x2264; N &#x2264; 60,1 &#x2264; K &#x2264; N ),as mentioned above.<br><br>   The next N lines, each lines contains two integer x<sub>i</sub> and y<sub>i</sub>  (-10<sup>9</sup>  &#x2264; x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>  &#x2264; 10<sup>9</sup>), denote the coordinates of city i.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"   For each test case, print a line &#x201C;Case #t: &#x201D;(without quotes, t means the index of the test case) at the beginning.
