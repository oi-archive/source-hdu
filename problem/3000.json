So, he decide to invent a new language to reduce the burden on students. <br><br>This new language only support four data type, but the syntax is an strict subset of C. It only support assignment operation, brackets operation , addition , subtration, multiplication and division between variables and numbers. The priority of operations is the same as C. <br><br>In order to void the problem of forgetting the eliminator &quot;;&quot;, this new language allow to omit it. <br><br>The variable naming rules is the same as C. <br><br>Comments is not allowed in this language. <br><br>Now Prof.X need to impelment this language, and the variable part is done by himself. Now Prof.X need you, a execllent ACM coder&apos;s help: Given a section of this language&apos;s code, please calculate it&apos;s return value.
