Each part of this graph has N vertices, i.e. the graph is balanced. An integer number (called a weight) assigns to each vertex. The weight of the edge is defined as the product of weights of vertices which connected by this edge.<br>It is well known, a matching in a graph is a set of edges without common vertices. A matching is perfect, if it covers all vertices of a graph.<br>Write a program to find a perfect match of the given bipartite graph with the maximal weight of the matching edges minimal.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of multiple cases.<br>For each testcase,there will be exactly three lines;<br>The first line contains one integer number N (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 10<sup>5</sup>).
