But most of them are not familiar with degree constrained spanning tree.<br>a degree-constrained spanning tree is a spanning tree which the maximum vertex degree is limited to a certain constant d. <br>Given two integers n and d, your task is to count the number of degree constrained spanning trees of a (labeled) complete graph with n vertices. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Each line contains two integers n, d. 1&lt;=n&lt;=100, 1&lt;=k&lt;=100.
