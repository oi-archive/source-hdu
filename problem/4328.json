Mark is worried about how to divide the cake since it&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s so huge and ray_sun is so strange. Ray_sun is a nut, you can never imagine how strange he was, is, and going to be. He does not eat rice, moves like a cat, sleeps during work and plays games when the rest of the world are sleeping&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;It is not a surprise when he has some special requirements for the cake. A considering guy as Mark is, he will never let ray_sun down. However, he does have trouble fulfilling ray_sun&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s wish this time; could you please give him a hand by solving the following problem for him?<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;The cake can be divided into n*m blocks. Each block is colored either in blue or red. Ray_sun will only eat a piece (consisting of several blocks) with special shape and color. First, the shape of the piece should be a rectangle. Second, the color of blocks in the piece should be the same or red-and-blue crisscross. The so called &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;red-and-blue crisscross&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; is demonstrated in the following picture. Could you please help Mark to find out the piece with maximum perimeter that satisfies ray_sun&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s requirements?<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C400-1009-1.jpg\"></center><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer T (T &lt;= 20), the number of test cases.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;For each case, there are two given integers, n, m, (1 &lt;= n, m &lt;= 1000) denoting the dimension of the cake.
