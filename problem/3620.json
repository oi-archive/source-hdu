Every weekends, he goes to the rink in his town. The rink is a rectangle that made up of r rows and c colomns of small squares. Some of squares are damaged and skating on these squares are forbidden. <br><br>FJ is a beginner, and he can only do a sequence of k actions one after another. One action means skating forward at most l squares (Doesn&apos;t include the square he start at) in a certain direction (Up, Down, Left and Right). Notice that he can&apos;t skate on broken squares. <br><br>Now the problem is: Given the rink and the sequence of actions, how long can FJ skating at most. <br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input file is a single integer T (1 &#x2264; T &#x2264; 10) - the number of test cases. For each test case, in the first line there are 5 integers: r, c, x, y, k. The meaning of r, c and k are described as above. x and y means FJ is at the square in the x-th row (counting from the top and start from 1) and y-th colomn (counting from the left side and start from 1). Then there are r lines, describing the rink - &apos;.&apos; means good squares, and &apos;x&apos; means broken squares. Then there are k lines, giving the k actions in order. Each of these lines contain 2 integers: l and d, d &#x2208; {1, 2, 3, 4}, 1 represent upward, 2 represent left, 3 represent downward and 4 represent right. <br><br>(1 &#x2264; r, c &#x2264; 200; 1 &#x2264; k &#x2264; 200); <br><br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Output a single integer, the maxmum number of square FJ can skate throuth.
