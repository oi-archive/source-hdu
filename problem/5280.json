Among all non-empty intervals of $A$, she wants to find the most beautiful one. She defines the beauty as the sum of the interval. The beauty of the interval---$[L,R]$ is calculated by this formula : beauty(L,R) = $A[L]+A[L+1]+......+A[R]$. The most beautiful interval is the one with maximum beauty.<br><br>But as is known to all, Xuejiejie is used to pursuing perfection. She wants to get a more beautiful interval. So she asks Mini-Sun for help. Mini-Sun is a magician, but he is busy reviewing calculus. So he tells Xuejiejie that he can just help her change one value of the element of $A$ to $P$ . Xuejiejie plans to come to see him in tomorrow morning.<br><br>Unluckily, Xuejiejie oversleeps. Now up to you to help her make the decision which one should be changed(You must change one element).","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"In the first line there is an integer $T$, indicates the number of test cases.<br><br>In each case, the first line contains two integers $n$ and $P$. $n$ means the number of elements of the array. $P$ means the value Mini-Sun can change to. <br><br>The next line contains the original array.<br><br>$1\\leq n\\leq 1000$, $-10^9\\leq A[i], P\\leq 10^9$&#x3002;","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one integer which means the most beautiful interval&apos;s beauty after your change.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n3 5\n1 -1 2\n3 -2\n1 -1 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">8\n2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=BestCoder+Round+%2347+%28%24%29&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> BestCoder Round #47 ($) </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
