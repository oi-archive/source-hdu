Yuta is worrying about this situation, so he gives Rikka some math tasks to practice. There is one of them:<br><br><br>Yuta have a sequence. Because the sequence is very self-willed(RenXing), at first the sequence is empty. And then Yuta do n operations on this sequence, each operation is either of these two types:<br><br><br>1.Add a number w into each gap of the sequence. For example if w=3 and the sequence before is &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;2 4&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, it will be changed to &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;3 2 3 4 3&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;.<br>**after the first operation of the first type, there is only one number in the sequence**<br><br><br>2.Query the kth small number in the subsequence [L,R]. For example if k=2, L=2, R=4 and the sequence is &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;3 2 3 4 2&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, the answer will be 3.<br><br><br>Yuta wants Rikka to tell him the answer of each query.<br><br><br>It is too difficult for Rikka.
