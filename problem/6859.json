He is very passionate in those cutting-edge thinkings, especially in Hamiltonian path problem, which is a well-known typical NPC problem.<br><br>In the mathematical field of graph theory, a Hamiltonian path is a path in an undirected or directed graph that visits each vertex exactly once. Mathematicians have spent hundreds of years, trying to find a general yet elegant solution of this problem, but still, the problem is only solved in a limited scope.<br><br>Cuber QQ wants to take one step forward, by solving the Hamiltonian path problem in the grid. A grid has $n \\times m$ vertices. We use a typical coordinate system in the grid, where each vertex on the grid is labelled by a pair of integers $(x, y)$ $(1 \\le x \\le n, 1 \\le y \\le m)$, and it is connected to adjacent vertices (if they are available), i.e., $(x-1, y)$, $(x+1, y)$, $(x, y-1)$, $(x, y+1)$.<br><br>The problem seems too trivial to him, Cuber QQ will take another step forward to find a Hamiltonian path in the grid without visiting the vertex $(N_x,N_y)$ $(1 \\le N_x \\le n, 1 \\le N_y \\le m)$, and the starting vertex must be located at $(S_x,S_y)$ $(1 \\le S_x \\le n, 1 \\le S_y \\le m)$. It is a little too difficult for him now and he asks you for help.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer $T$ ($T \\le 2~500$), denoting the number of test cases.<br><br>Each test case has six space-separated integers $n,m,N_x,N_y,S_x,S_y$ ($1\\le N_x,S_x\\le n \\le 200$, $1\\le N_y, S_y\\le m \\le 200$, $N_x\\neq S_x$ or $N_y \\neq S_y$) in one line.<br><br>It is guaranteed that $\\sum n+m\\le 10^5$.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, if there is no solution, print a single integer $-1$ in one line, otherwise the first line output an integer $nm - 1$, which is the length of the path.
