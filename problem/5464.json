One day, Clarke turned into a student and read a book.<br>Suddenly, a difficult problem appears:  <br>You are given a sequence of number $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and a number $p$. Count the number of the way to choose some of number(choose none of them is also a solution) from the sequence that sum of the numbers is a multiple of $p$($0$ is also count as a multiple of $p$).
