There are N houses in the city and these houses can be seen as N points P<sub>1</sub> &#x2026;&#x2026; P<sub>N</sub> on the two dimensional plane. For simplicity&apos;s sake, assume that the time spent from one house number to another is equal to the distance between two points corresponding to the house numbers. The government decides to build M \ffire stations from N houses. (If a station is build in Pi, We can think the station is next to the house and the time from the station to the house is considered zero.) It is obvious that if some place such as Pi is breaking out of fire, the nearest station will dispatched a \ffire engine quickly rushed to the rescue scene. The time it takes from this station to the rescue scene is called rescue time. Now you need to consider about a problem that how to choice the positions of the M \ffire station to minimize the max rescue time of all the houses.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The fi\frst line of the input contains one integer T, where T is the number of cases.

Then N lines is following. The ith line contains two integers Xi and Yi (0 &#x2264; Xi, Yi &#x2264; 10000), which stands for the coordinate of the ith house.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"The rescue time which makes the max rescue time is minimum.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n4 2\n1 1\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n4 1\n1 1\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1.000000\n2.236068</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Author","content":"wwr &amp; fengzlzl","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2010+Asia+Regional+Chengdu+Site+%A1%AA%A1%AA+Online+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2010 Asia Regional Chengdu Site &#x2014;&#x2014; Online Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
