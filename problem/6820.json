A weighted tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles and each edge has a weight. The degree of each vertex is the number of vertexes which connect with it. Now Aphelios has a weighted tree $T$ with $n$ vertex and an integer $k$, and now he wants to find a subgraph $G$ of the tree, which satisfies the following conditions:<br><br>$1$. $G$ should be a connected graph, in other words, each vertex can reach any other vertex in the subgraph $G$.<br><br>$2$. the number of the vertex whose degree is larger than $k$ is no more than $1$.<br><br>$3$. the total weight of the subgraph is <b> as large as possiblie</b>.<br><br>Now output the maximum total weight of the subgraph you can find.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer $q$, which represents the number of test cases.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains two integer $n$ and $k$ $(1\\leq n\\leq 2 \\times 10^{5},0\\leq k&lt;n)$.<br><br>For next $n-1$ lines , each line contains $3$ numbers $u,v,d$, which means that there is an edge between $u$ and $v$ weighted $d$ $(1\\leq u,v\\leq n,0\\leq d \\leq 10^{9})$.<br><br>You may assume that $\\sum n \\leq 10^{6}$.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one line containing a single integer $ans$ denoting the total weight of the subgraph.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n5 2\n1 2 5\n2 3 2\n2 4 3\n2 5 4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">14</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2020+Multi-University+Training+Contest+5&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2020 Multi-University Training Contest 5 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
