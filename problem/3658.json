Therefore, that means you can pick some same letters. But here are two rules:<br>&#x25CF; as to all the neighbour letters, the absolute value of their ASCII code must be not greater than 32.<br>&#x25CF; there must be at least one pair of neighbour letters whose absolute value of ASCII code is exactly equal to 32. For example, considering the word in the form like &quot;Xx&quot; or &quot;xX&quot;, the neighbour letters have an absolute value of ASCII code exactly equal to 32.<br>Now how many di\u000berent words can we get?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The \ffirst line of input is the number of test case.
