So Samuel only got a passing score in the experiment this semester.  Dealing with the figures that get from the experiment requires a lot of energy and time,and it is not valuable to do it by press the calculator to get answer. So Samuel and his roommates often  make up a program to work it out. Can you help Samuel make a program?<br>    The problem is not hard. You only need to figure out the average M of n number(double type x1,x2,x3...xn) (the precision set as 10).<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"test cases t,each of a test case contains a number n(an integer) and n figures(double type).","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Output the average M by &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;The average M = m.&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;here m is a number.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n3 1.0 1.2 1.1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">The average M = 1.1000000000.</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"Samuel","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=%BB%D2%C9%AB%B3%C8%D7%D3+%D7%A8%B3%A1&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x26B;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; &#x5E8;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
