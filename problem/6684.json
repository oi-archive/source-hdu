Given a string $s$ with only lowercase letters. Rikka and Yuta need to operate the string in turns while the first operation is taken by Rikka.<br><br>In each turn, the player has two choices: The first one is to terminate the game, and the second one is to select an index $i$ of $s$ and right shift the value of char $s_i$, i.e., $a \\rightarrow b, b \\rightarrow c, \\dots, y \\rightarrow z, z \\rightarrow a$.<br><br>If the game is still alive after $2^{101}$ turns, i.e., after Yuta finishes his $2^{100}$ turns, the game will end automatically. The final result is the value of $s$ when the game is over.<br><br>Now, Rikka wants to minimize the lexicographical order of the result while Yuta wants to maximize it. You are required to calculate the result of the game if both Rikka and Yuta play optimally.<br><br>For two string $a$ and $b$ with equal length $m$, $a$ is lexicographically smaller than $b$ if and only if there exists an index $i \\in [1,n]$ which satisfies $a_i &lt; b_i$ and $a_j = b_j$ holds for all $j \\in [1,i)$.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T(1 \\leq T \\leq 100)$, the number of test cases.<br><br>For each test case, the input contains a single line with a single string with only lowercase letters, the initial value of $s(1 \\leq |s| \\leq 100)$.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output a single line with a single string, the answer.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\na\nzbc</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">a\nbbc</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2019+Multi-University+Training+Contest+9&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2019 Multi-University Training Contest 9 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
