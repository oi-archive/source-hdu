In this problem, you are given $n$ points in the Euclidean plane and you need to find a pair of points with the smallest distance between them.<br><br>Now, Claris, the brilliant one who has participated in programming contests for several years, is trying to solve a harder problem named the closest pair of segments problem, which also has a quite simple description as above.<br><br>However, the problem seems even too hard for Claris and she is asking you for help.<br><br>Now $n$ segments are lying on the Euclidean plane, you are asked to pick two different segments and then pick a point on the two segments respectively to minimize the distance between these two points.<br><br>For simplicity, any two given segments share no common point, and you don&apos;t need to show her the two chosen points, but the distance between them instead.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases, and the first line contains a single integer $T~(1 \\le T \\le 200)$, the number of test cases.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains one integer $n~(2 \\le n \\le 10\\,000)$, which is the number of segments on the Euclidean plane.<br><br>The following $n$ lines describe all the segments lying on the Euclidean plane, the $i$-th of which contains for integers $x_1, y_1, x_2$ and $y_2$ describing a segment that connects $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, where $-10^9 \\le x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \\le 10^9$.<br><br>It&apos;s guaranteed that the two endpoints of each segment do not coincide, any two given segments do not intersect with each other in each test case, and no more than $20$ test cases satisfy $n&gt;1\\,000$.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output a line containing a single real number for the answer to  the closest pair of segments problem with an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.<br><br>Precisely speaking, assume that your answer is $a$ and and the jury&apos;s answer is $b$, your answer will be considered correct if and only if $\\frac{|a - b|}{\\max\\{1, |b|\\}} \\le 10^{-6}$.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n2\n0 1 1 2\n1 1 2 0\n2\n0 1 1 2\n2 2 3 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">0.707106781187\n1.000000000000</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2019+Multi-University+Training+Contest+10&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2019 Multi-University Training Contest 10 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
