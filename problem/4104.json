Assume a shop offers a 20% off if your bill is more than 100 yuan, and with more than 500 yuan, you can get a 40% off. After you have chosen a good of 400 yuan, the best suggestion for you is to take something else to reach 500 yuan and get the 40% off.<br>For the customers&#x2019; convenience, the shops often offer some low-price and useful items just for reaching such a condition. But there are still many customers complain that they can&#x2019;t reach exactly the budget they want. So, the manager wants to know, with the items they offer, what is the minimum budget that cannot be reached. In addition, although the items are very useful, no one wants to buy the same thing twice.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists several testcases.<br>The first line contains one integer N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000), the number of items available.<br>The second line contains N integers P<sub>i</sub> (0 &lt;= P<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 10000), represent the ith item&#x2019;s price.<br><br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Print one integer, the minimum budget that cannot be reached.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4\n1 2 3 4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">11</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2011+Alibaba-Cup+Campus+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2011 Alibaba-Cup Campus Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
