For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.---Wikipedia <br><br>BrotherK and Ery like playing mathematic games. Today, they are playing a game with GCD. <br><br>BrotherK has an array $A$ with $N$ elements: $A_1$ ~ $A_N$, each element is a integer in [1, 10^9]. Ery has $Q$ questions, the i-th question is to calculate<br>GCD($A_{L_i},~A_{L_i + 1},~A_{L_i + 2},~...,~A_{R_i}$), and BrotherK will tell her the answer. <br><br>BrotherK feels tired after he has answered $Q$ questions, so Ery can only play with herself, but she don&apos;t know any elements in array $A$.
