Each of them has a branch (a branch is not a company, and companies and branches are all called &quot;unit&quot;).The branches are labeled from -1 to &#xFFFD;CN. The branch of company i is labeled as -i. The number of workers of each company and its branch has to fit the rules below:<br>      1. The number of workers of a company must be larger than that of the branch of it.<br>      2. There are more workers in company i than company j if and only if there are more workers in the branch of company i than the branch of company j.<br>      Among the companies whose label is larger than i&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;range from i+1 to n&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;,and the branches whose label is larger than -i (range from -1 to &#xFFFD;C(i-1) ), there are c[i] units which have more workers than company i.<br>      You need to sort the 2&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;N units in the ascending order by the number of workers.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"      The input contains multiple test cases.
