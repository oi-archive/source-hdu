If you have ever tried to get a train ticket at that time, you must have witnessed the endless queues in front of every ticket box window. If a guy has seen his friend in a queue, then it is very much likely that this lucky guy might go straight to his friend and ask for a favor. This is called &quot;jumping the queue&quot;. It is unfair to the rest of the people in the line, but, it is life. Your task is to write a program that simulates such a queue with people jumping in every now and then, assume that, if one in the queue has several friends asking for favors, he would arrange their requests in a queue of his own.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There will contain one or more test cases. Each test case begins with the number of groups n (1&lt;= n &lt;=1000). Then n group descriptions follow, each one consisting of the number of friends belonging to the group and those people&apos;s distinct names. A group is a friend group. People in one group are friend with each other. A name is a string of up to 4 characters chosen from {A, B, ..., Z, a, b, ..., z}. A group may consist of up to 1000 friends. You may assume that there is no one belong to two different groups. <br>Finally, a list of commands follows. There are three different kinds of commands: <br><br>&#x25CF; <b>ENQUEUE X</b> - Mr. or Ms. X goes into the queue <br>&#x25CF; <b>DEQUEUE</b> - the first person gets the ticket and leave the queue <br>&#x25CF; <b>STOP</b> - end of test case <br><br>The input will be terminated by a value of 0 for n.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, first print a line saying &quot;Scenario #k&quot;, where k is the number of the test case. Then, for each <b>DEQUEUE</b> command, print the person who just gets a ticket on a single line. Print a blank line between two test cases, but no extra line at the end of output.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n3 Ann Bob Joe\n3 Zoe Jim Fat\nENQUEUE Ann\nENQUEUE Zoe\nENQUEUE Bob\nENQUEUE Jim\nENQUEUE Joe\nENQUEUE Fat\nDEQUEUE\nDEQUEUE\nDEQUEUE\nDEQUEUE\nDEQUEUE\nDEQUEUE\nSTOP\n2\n5 Anny Jack Jean Bill Jane\n6 Eva Mike Ron Sony Geo Zoro\nENQUEUE Anny\nENQUEUE Eva\nENQUEUE Jack\nENQUEUE Jean\nENQUEUE Bill\nENQUEUE Jane\nDEQUEUE\nDEQUEUE\nENQUEUE Mike\nENQUEUE Ron\nDEQUEUE\nDEQUEUE\nDEQUEUE\nDEQUEUE\nSTOP \n0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Scenario #1 \nAnn\nBob\nJoe\nZoe\nJim\nFat\n\nScenario #2 \nAnny\nJack\nJean\nBill\nJane\nEva\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nYou must maintain a hash table to store the names of the people, otherwise the efficiency of your program will not be acceptable since Judge&apos;s input file\n is as large as about 12.5MB.\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Author","content":"hjr","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2008+HZNU+Programming+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2008 HZNU Programming Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
