The following optimization problem is not advanced, nor is it particularly interesting.  You are to write a program to determine the minimum number of buttons a person must push to set their alarm clock. Assume the alarm clock has 7 buttons &#x2013; hour-up, hour-down, tens-minute-up, and tens-minute-down, ones-minute-up, ones-minute-down, and am/pm.  For example, continuously pushing the hour-up button will cause hour digit to go through the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, &#x2026;.  Pushing the hour-down button will cause the sequence to go in the reverse order.  Pushing the tens-minute-up buttons cycles tens minute digit through the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 1, &#x2026;   Pushing the ones-minute-up button cycles the one digit through the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, &#x2026; Pushing the am/pm button causes toggles the am/pm indicator.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input will contain an integer indicating the number of problems that need to be processed.
