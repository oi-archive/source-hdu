The sum of a rectangle is the sum of all the elements in that rectangle. In this problem the sub-rectangle with the largest sum is referred to as the maximal sub-rectangle.<br><br>As an example, the maximal sub-rectangle of the array:<br><br>0 -2 -7 0<br>9 2 -6 2<br>-4 1 -4 1<br>-1 8 0 -2<br><br>is in the lower left corner:<br><br>9 2<br>-4 1<br>-1 8<br><br>and has a sum of 15.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of an N x N array of integers. The input begins with a single positive integer N on a line by itself, indicating the size of the square two-dimensional array. This is followed by N 2 integers separated by whitespace (spaces and newlines). These are the N 2 integers of the array, presented in row-major order. That is, all numbers in the first row, left to right, then all numbers in the second row, left to right, etc. N may be as large as 100. The numbers in the array will be in the range [-127,127].<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Output the sum of the maximal sub-rectangle.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4\n0 -2 -7 0 9 2 -6 2\n-4 1 -4 1 -1\n8 0 -2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">15</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=Greater+New+York+2001&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> Greater New York 2001 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
