He used this power for several times. He found out that this power was not as perfect as he wanted. For example, some of the cloned objects were tall, while some were short; some of them were fat, and some were thin. <br><br>More evidence showed that for two clones A and B, if A was no worse than B in all fields, then B could not survive. More specifically, DRD used a vector v to represent each of his clones. The vector v has n dimensions, representing a clone having N abilities. For the i-th dimension, v[i] is an integer between 0 and T[i], where 0 is the worst and T[i] is the best. For two clones A and B, whose corresponding vectors were p and q, if for 1 &lt;= i &lt;= N, p[i] &gt;= q[i], then B could not survive. <br><br>Now, as DRD&apos;s friend, ATM wants to know how many clones can survive at most.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of the test cases.<br><br>For each test case: The first line contains 1 integer N, 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 2000.
