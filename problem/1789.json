Now he has a lot of homework to do. Every teacher gives him a deadline of handing in the homework. If Ignatius hands in the homework after the deadline, the teacher will reduce his score of the final test. And now we assume that doing everyone homework always takes one day. So Ignatius wants you to help him to arrange the order of doing homework to minimize the reduced score.
