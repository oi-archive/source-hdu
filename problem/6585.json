But they are not bored or afraid at all, because they found a truly interesting thing to do: researching the varied kinds of kakti in the desert!<br>After careful observations, they found that a kaktus can be seen as a graph consisting of several nodes. To be precise, an $n$-node kaktus is an undirected connected graph that has only $1$ node as the root, in which every edge belongs to exactly one simple cycle and all nodes are unlabelled. You can refer to sample case for a better understanding.<br>Finding something new is always exciting, but it brings them new doubts.<br><i>&quot;How many different kinds of $n$-node kakti are there?&quot;</i> wondered Tom.<br><i>&quot;Your problem is simpler than mine. I am wondering how many different kinds of $1,2,3,..,n$-node kakti there are.&quot;</i> said Jerry.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"One line containing a number $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$).","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"$n$ lines, each line containing a number, the number of $n$-node kakti.<br><br>As these numbers can be very large, output them modulo $998244353$.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n1\n3\n8\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nHere are the 8 4-node kakti.\n<center><img src=\"../../../data/images/C722-1008-1.jpg\"></center> \n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2019+Multi-University+Training+Contest+1&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2019 Multi-University Training Contest 1 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
