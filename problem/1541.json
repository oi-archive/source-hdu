Let the level of a star be an amount of the stars that are not higher and not to the right of the given star. Astronomers want to know the distribution of the levels of the stars. <br><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1541-1.jpg\"><br><br>For example, look at the map shown on the figure above. Level of the star number 5 is equal to 3 (it&apos;s formed by three stars with a numbers 1, 2 and 4). And the levels of the stars numbered by 2 and 4 are 1. At this map there are only one star of the level 0, two stars of the level 1, one star of the level 2, and one star of the level 3. <br><br>You are to write a program that will count the amounts of the stars of each level on a given map.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input file contains a number of stars N (1&lt;=N&lt;=15000). The following N lines describe coordinates of stars (two integers X and Y per line separated by a space, 0&lt;=X,Y&lt;=32000). There can be only one star at one point of the plane. Stars are listed in ascending order of Y coordinate. Stars with equal Y coordinates are listed in ascending order of X coordinate.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"The output should contain N lines, one number per line.
