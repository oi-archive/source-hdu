You can see that if one part has 100 points and the other has only 1 point, then this partition cannot be beautiful since it&apos;s too imbalanced. DRD wants to find a line to separate $S$, so that no points lie in the line and there are at least $\\lfloor \\frac{|S|}{3}\\rfloor$ points in each side of the line. DRD finds it amazing that there may exist some points (no need to be in $S$) that if a line $l$ passes it and does not pass any points in $S$, then $l$ can be a separating line. Now, he wonders the area these points form. <br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"First line: a positive integer $T \\leq 10$ indicating the number of test cases.<br>There are $T$ cases following. In each case, the first line contains an positive integer $n \\leq 1000$, and $n$ lines follow. In each of these lines, there are 2 integers $x_i, y_i$ indicating a point $(x_i, y_i)$ in the plane.
