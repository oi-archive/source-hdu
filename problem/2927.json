A typical Formula One season consists of a series of races called ``Grands Prix&quot; which constructors like Ferrari, Renault, etc. and others participate with one or more cars driven by the best drivers in the world. During the season, teams compete in two parallel championships: the drivers championship and the teams championship.<br><br>In the drivers championship, drivers compete to achieve the maximum total number of points by the end of the season, the rules of the competition states that the top eight drivers at each Grand Prix receive 10,8,6,5,4,3,2,1 points respectively. In case of points tie, the driver with the highest number of first places leads. If still tied, then the highest second places, and so on till the highest 8th places. If still tied, then drivers are sorted lexicographically by their last and then by their first names.<br><br>After each race, the points received by each driver are added to his team&apos;s pocket, and at the end of the season the team with the highest number of points wins the teams championship. To add excitement to the season, team sponsors are allowed to buy drivers from other teams even within the same season. In case of points tie between teams, teams are sorted lexicographically by their names. In this problem, you are given data of a formula one season and you&apos;re asked to process these data according to the rules above to determine both the drivers and teams standings.

For each Grand Prix, the name of the Grand Prix appears on a line by itself (maximum length is 64 characters) followed by a table of the first name, last name and team name of the top eight drivers, from 1 to 8, in that Grand Prix. Each of the first and last names is a sequence of printable ASCII characters, no longer than 12 characters, and contains no spaces. Each team name is a sequence of printable ASCII characters, no longer than 18 characters, and may contain spaces (but no leading or trailing spaces.) Each team name is followed by a single period `.&apos; which is not part of the name. Trailing white space may follow. A line of three -&apos;s follows the listing of each Grand Prix.
