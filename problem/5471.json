Rows are numbered 1, 2, 3, ... , h from top to bottom while columns are numbered 1, 2 , 3, ... , w from left to right. Each cell can be represented by a pair of numbers (x, y), which means this cell is located at row x column y.<br>You fill the every cell with an integer ranging from 1 to m.<br>Then you start to play with the gird. Every time you chose a rectangle whose upper left cell is (x1, y1) and lower right cell is (x2, y2), finally you calculate the maximum value v of this rectangle.<br>After you played n times, you left. When you return, you find that the grid is disappeared. You only remember n rectangles and their corresponding maximum value. You are wondering how many different gird can satisfy your memory. Two grids are different if there is a cell filled different integer.<br>Give your answer modulo ($10^9 + 7$).<br>Your memory may have some mistakes so that no grid satisfies it, in this case just output 0.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Multiple test cases.
