The teacher gives Bob a list of  problems about GCD (Greatest Common Divisor). After studying some of them, Bob thinks that GCD is so interesting. One day, he comes up with a new problem about GCD. Easy as it looks, Bob cannot figure it out himself. Now he turns to you for help, and here is the problem:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Given an array $a$ of $N$ positive integers $a_1, a_2, \\cdots a_{N-1}, a_N$; a subarray of $a$ is defined as a continuous interval between $a_1$ and $a_N$. In other words, $a_i, a_{i+1}, \\cdots, a_{j-1}, a_j$ is a subarray of $a$, for $1\\le i\\le j\\le N$. For a query in the form $(L, R)$, tell the number of different GCDs contributed by all subarrays of the interval $[L, R]$.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several tests, process till the end of input.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;For each test, the first line consists of two integers $N$ and $Q$, denoting the length of the array and the number of queries, respectively. $N$ positive integers are listed in the second line, followed by $Q$ lines each containing two integers $L,R$ for a query.<br><br>You can assume that <br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;$1\\le N,Q\\le100000$ <br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;  $1\\le a_i\\le1000000$","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each query, output the answer in one line.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5 3\n1 3 4 6 9\n3 5\n2 5\n1 5</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">6\n6\n6</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2016+ACM%2FICPC+Asia+Regional+Dalian+Online&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2016 ACM/ICPC Asia Regional Dalian Online </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
