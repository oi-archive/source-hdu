The stability of connectedness between node $u$ and node $v$ is defined by the number of edges in this graph which determines the connectedness between them (once we delete this edge, node $u$ and $v$ would be disconnected).<br><br>    You need to maintain the graph $G$, support the deletions of edges (though we guarantee the graph would always be connected), and answer the query of stability for two given nodes.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases(no more than $3$ cases), and the first line contains an integer $t$, meaning the totally number of test cases.<br><br>    For each test case, the first line contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $q$, where $1 \\le n \\le 3 \\times 10^4, 1 \\le m \\le 10^5$ and $1 \\le q \\le 10^5$.
