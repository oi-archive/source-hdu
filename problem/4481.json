If you pass the left or the right of one gate, this gate should not be considered as a gate that you passed through. The i<sup>th</sup> gate occurs at distance y<sub>i</sub> down the hill, with the horizontal position of the i<sup>th</sup> gate given by x<sub>i</sub>. Each gate is further down the hill than the previous gate (i.e. y<sub>i</sub> &lt; y<sub>i+1</sub> for all i).<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;Your pairs of skis has speed v<sub>d</sub> (i.e. you move with a constant downward velocity of v<sub>d</sub> meters per second). Additionally, at any time you may move at a horizontal speed of at most v<sub>h</sub> meters per second.<br>You may start and finish at any two positions. Your task now is to calculate how many gates at most that you can pass through.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"&#x3000;&#x3000;There is an integer T (1 &lt;= T &lt;= 1000) in the first line, which indicates there are T test cases in total.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;For each test case, there are three integers N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 30000), v<sub>d</sub> (1 &lt;= v<sub>d</sub> &lt;= 10000) and v<sub>h</sub> (1 &lt;= v<sub>h</sub> &lt;= 10000) in the first line, which have the same meaning as above.
