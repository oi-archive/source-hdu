So much so that he always keeps three watches with him, so that he can be sure exactly what the time is. However, Percy&apos;s having a bad day. He found out that one of his watches was giving the wrong time. What&apos;s worse, when he went to correct the watch, he corrected the wrong one! That is, one watch was running x minutes behind (where x &lt;= 480) and he wound one of the other watches x minutes forward. He now has three watches reading three different times, and hence is in serious danger of being tardy. Can you help Percy by writing a program that takes in the three times displayed on the watches and returns the correct time?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input begins with an integer T indicating the number of cases that follow (0 &lt; T<br>&lt; 100).
