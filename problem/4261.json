Pare it down! Estimate!&#x201D;<br>You are disappointed. It took a lot of work to generate those numbers. But, you&#x2019;ll do what your boss asks.<br>You decide to estimate in the following way: You have an array <strong>A</strong> of numbers. You will partition it into <strong>k</strong> contiguous sections, which won&#x2019;t necessarily be of the same size. Then, you&#x2019;ll use a single number to estimate an entire section. In other words, for your array <strong>A</strong> of size <strong>n</strong>, you want to create another array <strong>B</strong> of size <strong>n</strong>, which has <strong>k</strong> contiguous sections. If i and j are in the same section, then <strong>B</strong>[i]=<strong>B</strong>[j]. You want to minimize the error, expressed as the sum of the absolute values of the differences (<strong>&#x3A3;</strong>|<strong>A</strong>[i]-<strong>B</strong>[i]|).","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There will be several test cases in the input. Each test case will begin with two integers on a line, <strong>n</strong> (1&#x2264;<strong>n</strong>&#x2264;2,000) and <strong>k</strong> (1&#x2264;<strong>k</strong>&#x2264;25, <strong>k</strong>&#x2264;<strong>n</strong>), where <strong>n</strong> is the size of the array, and <strong>k</strong> is the number of contiguous sections to use in estimation. The array <strong>A</strong> will be on the next <strong>n</strong> lines, one integer per line. Each integer element of <strong>A</strong> will be in the range from -10,000 to 10,000, inclusive. The input will end with a line with two 0s.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output a single integer on its own line, which is the minimum error you can achieve.
