Bonnie, her best friend, suggested her to throw a question to them, and she would choose the one who can solve it.<br><br><b>Suppose there is a tree with n vertices and n - 1 edges, and there is a value at each vertex. The root is vertex 1.</b> Then for each vertex, could you tell me how many vertices of its subtree can be said to be co-prime with itself?<br>NOTES: Two vertices are said to be co-prime if their values&apos; GCD (greatest common divisor) equals 1.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiply tests (no more than 8).<br>For each test, the first line has a number $n$ $(1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5)$, after that has $n-1$ lines, each line has two numbers a and b $(1 \\leq a,b \\leq n)$, representing that vertex a is connect with vertex b. Then the next line has n numbers, the $i^{th}$ number indicates the value of the $i^{th}$ vertex. Values of vertices are not less than 1 and not more than $10^5$.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test, at first, please output &quot;Case #k: &quot;, k is the number of test.
