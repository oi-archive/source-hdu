For each tree, node 1 is the root, and every other node has its father&apos;s index less than itself. Also, there are weights on the nodes. Two nodes in different trees can have the same weight, buf two nodes in the same tree can&apos;t.<br>Now given the two trees and Q queries. Each query follows the format &quot;u1 v1 u2 v2&quot;. Let S1 be the set of all node weights on the paths between u1 and v1 on the first tree, S2 be the set of all node weights on the paths between u2 and v2 on the second tree. You should output the number of elements in both S1 and S2. (e.g. the size of the intersection of S1 and S2)","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases (no more than 50).<br>For each case, the first three lines describe the first tree.
