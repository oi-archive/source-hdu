Now, Willy must escape!<br>Given a description of the apple (defined as a convex shape in 3D space), and a list of possible positions in the apple for Willy (defined as 3D points), determine the minimum distance Willy must travel to get to the surface of the apple from each point.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There will be several test cases in the input. Each test case will begin with a line with a single integer <strong>n</strong> (4&#x2264;<strong>n</strong>&#x2264;1,000), which tells the number of points describing the apple.<br>On the next <strong>n</strong> lines will be three integers <strong>x</strong>, <strong>y</strong> and <strong>z</strong> (-10,000&#x2264;<strong>x</strong>,<strong>y</strong>,<strong>z</strong>&#x2264;10,000), where each point (<strong>x</strong>,<strong>y</strong>,<strong>z</strong>) is either on the surface of, or within, the apple. The apple is the convex hull of these points. No four points will be coplanar.<br>Following the description of the apple, there will be a line with a single integer <strong>q</strong> (1&#x2264;<strong>q</strong>&#x2264;100,000), which is the number of queries &#x2013; that is, the number of points where Willy might be inside the apple.
