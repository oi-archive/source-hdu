He has n magical cards and each has a number on it. He wants to choose k cards and place them around in any order to form a circle. He can choose any several <b>consecutive</b> cards the number of which is m(1&lt;=m&lt;=k) to play a magic. The magic is simple that ZCC can get a number x=a1&#x2295;a2...&#x2295;am, which ai means the number on the ith card he chooses. He can play the magic infinite times, but <b>once he begin to play the magic, he can&#x2019;t change anything in the card circle including the order.</b><br>   ZCC has a lucky number L. ZCC want to obtain the number L~R by using one card circle. And if he can get other numbers which aren&#x2019;t in the range [L,R], it doesn&#x2019;t matter. Help him to find the maximal R.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The input contains several test cases.The first line in each case contains three integers n, k and L(k&#x2264;n&#x2264;20,1&#x2264;k&#x2264;6,1&#x2264;L&#x2264;100).
