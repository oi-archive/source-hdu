In order to reach the destination safely on time, you are asked to develop a system which has two types of main functions as below.<br>1: A B C D, reporting whether we can get from station A to station B without passing the railway that connects station C and station D.<br>2: A B C, reporting whether we can get from station A to station B without passing station C.<br>Please notice that the railways are UNDIRECTED.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"For each test case, the first line will contain two integers N (2&lt;=N&lt;=100000) and M (1&lt;=M&lt;=500000), namely the number of stations and railways in TC. Then each of the next M lines will have two integers, describing the two stations that a certain railway is connecting. After this, there comes a line containing a single integer Q (Q&lt;=300000), which means the number of queries to make on the system. The next Q lines will be queries. Each query begins with a integer, indicating the type of query, followed by 4 (the first type) or 3 (the second type) integers describing the details of the query as what mentioned above.<br>The stations are always labeled from 1 to N.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; in separated lines for the queries.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">13 15\n1 2\n2 3\n3 5\n2 4\n4 6\n2 6\n1 4\n1 7\n7 8\n7 9\n7 10\n8 11\n8 12\n9 12\n12 13\n5\n1 5 13 1 2\n1 6 2 1 4\n1 13 6 7 8\n2 13 6 7\n2 13 6 8</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">yes\nyes\nyes\nno\nyes</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2011+Multi-University+Training+Contest+6+-+Host+by+JLU&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2011 Multi-University Training Contest 6 - Host by JLU </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
