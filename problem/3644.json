Inspired by the famous quote above, recently, they are designing a new brand of chocolate named Life. Each piece of chocolate is a random simple polygon. After molding and shaping, every piece is put in a small box. Until you open the box, you will not know what you will get: a huge piece or only a tiny fraction. It is really like life and that is the reason it is named for.<br><br>However, here comes a problem. The manufacturer has to print the logo on each piece of chocolate. The logo is a circle with &#x2018;ACM&#x2019; inside. Here is an example below. It is fortunate that the logo can be printed on the chocolate.<br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/3644-1.jpg\"><br>Now the manufacturer is asking you for help. Given the information about the chocolate shape and the radius of the logo, you need to judge whether or not there is enough space to print the logo.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains no more than 20 cases, and each case is formatted as follows.<br>n <br>x<sub>1</sub> y<sub>1</sub> <br>x<sub>2</sub> y<sub>2</sub><br>&#x2026;<br>x<sub>n</sub> y<sub>n</sub> <br>r<br>The first line is the number of vertices of the polygon, n, which satisfies 3 &#x2264; n &#x2264; 50.
