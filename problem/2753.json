Keep the change. <br><br>When travelling to remote locations, it is often helpful to bring cash, in case you want to buy something from someone who does not accept credit or debit cards. It is also helpful to bring a variety of denominations in case the seller does not have change. Even so, you may not have the exact amount, and will have to pay a little bit more than full price. The same problem can arise even in urban locations, for example with vending machines that do not return change.<br><br>Of course, you would like to minimize the amount you pay (though you must pay at least as much as the value of the item). Moreover, while paying the minimum amount, you would like to minimize the number of coins or bills that you pay out.
