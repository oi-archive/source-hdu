Sometimes, when there is not much wind, days can pass by without any activity. To pass the time between chores, pirates like to play games with coins.<center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C392-1007-1.png\"></center><br>An old favorite of the pirates is a game for two players featuring one stack of coins. In turn, each player takes a number of coins from the stack. The number of coins that a player takes must be a power of a given integer K (1, K, K^2, etcetera). The winner is the player to take the last coin(s).<br>Can you help the pirates \fgure out how the player to move can win in a given game situation?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains a single number: the number of test cases to follow.
