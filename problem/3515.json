Then they  borrowed n theodolites&#xFF08;a tool used to measure angle of elevation&#xFF09;. The n theodolites were placed on the ground around the building, which formed an n-edge regular polygon. The building was inside the regular polygon. Each edge of the polygon is s meters, and the height of theodolite was h centimeters. They wrote down the angle of elevation in degrees from each theodolite to the top of the building. They wanted to calculate the building&apos;s height according to the data they measured.
