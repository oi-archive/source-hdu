Then every proposition procudes more propositions...... Finally there are $n$ propositions. These propositions can be regarded as a tree whose root is $1$.<br><br>We assume that the first proposition, whose number is $1$, belongs to the $0$-th generation, and those propositions produced by the $x$-th generation belong to the $x+1$-th generation. We also assume that all of the propositions in the $x$-th generation are in level $x$. Specially, Victor has discovered that the proposition whose number is $i$ can infer the proposition whose number is $x_i$ and all of the propositions in $x_i$&apos;s subtree, whose levels are not greater than $x_i$&apos;s level + $d_i$.<br><br>Notice : $a$ is $b$&apos;s father does not show that either $a$ can infer $b$ or $b$ can infer $a$.<br><br>Now please determine the number of such ordered pairs $(i,j)$, that $1\\leq i &lt; j\\leq n$, the proposition $i$ can infer the proposition $j$, and the proposition $j$ can also infer the proposition $i$.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.<br><br>In every test case, there is an integer $n$ in the first line, denoting the number of the propositions.<br><br>The second line contains $n-1$ integers, the $i$-th integer $f_{i+1}(f_i &lt; i)$ denotes that the proposition $i+1$ is produced by the proposition $f_{i+1}$.<br><br>Then there are $n$ lines, the $i$-th line contains two integers $x_i$ and $d_i$.<br><br>$1\\leq T\\leq 5$.<br><br>$2\\leq n\\leq 100000$.<br><br>$0\\leq d_i &lt; n$.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"Your program should print $T$ lines : the $i$-th of these should contain a single integer, denoting the number of such ordered pairs $(i,j)$.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n4\n1 2 1\n2 1\n1 0\n4 0\n2 0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">6\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nIf you need a larger stack size, \nplease use #pragma comment(linker, &quot;/STACK:102400000,102400000&quot;) and submit your solution using C++.</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=BestCoder+Round+%2352+%28div.2%29&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> BestCoder Round #52 (div.2) </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
