Each round they dice respectively and get the points P1 and P2 (1 &lt;= P1, P2 &lt;= 6). Small number who, whose HP to reduce 1, the same points will remain unchanged. If one of them becomes 0 HP, he loses.  <br>As a result of technical differences between the two, each person has different probability of throwing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
