War is an interaction in which two or more militaries have a &#x201C;struggle of wills&#x201D;. When qualified as a civil war, it is a dispute inherent to a given society, and its nature is in the conflict over modes of governance rather than sovereignty. War is not considered to be the same as mere occupation,murder or genocide because of the reciprical nature of the violent struggle, and the organized nature of the units involved. <br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;War is also a cultural entity, and its practice is not linked to any single type of political organisation or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his &#x201C;History Of Warfare&#x201D;, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C154-1001-1.jpg\"></center><br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Today we don&apos;t want to talk about war, rather than , I want you to tell me which year there was no war.
