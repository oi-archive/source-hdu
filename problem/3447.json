Recently he begins to learn C programming language. He is interested in the keyword of C and knows the importance of keywords. So each time he gets a C program source code, he counts the the appearance of the valid keyword first. However, when the code is long, John can&apos;t count it correctly. Now he needs your help, he will give you some C code, and he wants you tell him the correct number of the appearance of the keyword.<br>In order to make the problem easier. John provides you some information.<br>1, the code don&apos;t contain &quot;#define&quot;, i.e. the code don&apos;t contain the Macro definition .<br>2, the code may contain type cast, i.e. int a = (int)b;<br>3, the keywords in the comments are not valid.<br>4, the keywords in a string are not valid, and the character in the string will be expressed by letter. i.e. The string like &quot;ab\\x40&quot; will not appear.<br>5, it guarantees that a word or a statement is in the same line, but one line may contain many words or statements.<br>6, one line contain no more than 300 characters and one word is less than 50 characters.
