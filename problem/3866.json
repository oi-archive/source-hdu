Every contribution will be a multiple of 1 cent,i.e.,nobody can pay fractions of a cent.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>Everybody writes down the maxumum amount he is able to contribute. Taking into account these maximum amounts from everybody, your task is to share the cost of the present as fairly as possible. That means, you minimize the largest distance of the contributions to 1/n-th of the total cost.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>In case of a tie, minimize the second largest distance, and so on. Since the smallest unit of contribution is 1 cent, there might be more than one possible division of the cost. In that case, persons with a higher maximum amount pay more. If there is still ambiguity, those who come first in the list pay more.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>Since you bought the present, it is your task to figure out how much everybody has to pay.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"On the first line a positive integer: the number of test cases, at most 200.
