One day, he drew a table with several rows and columns, randomly wrote numbers on each elements of the table. Then he counted the sum of each row and column. Since he thought the map will be useless after he got the sums, he destroyed the table after that.<br><br>   However Dragon&apos;s mom came back and found what he had done. She would give dragon a feast if Dragon could reconstruct the table, otherwise keep Dragon hungry. Dragon is so young and so simple so that the original numbers in the table are one-digit number (e.g. 0-9).<br><br>   Could you help Dragon to do that?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The first line of input contains only one integer, T(&lt;=30), the number of test cases. Following T blocks, each block describes one test case.<br><br>   There are three lines for each block.

Each line should start with &quot;Case #i: &quot;, with i implying the case number. For each case, if we cannot get the original table, just output: &quot;So naive!&quot;, else if we can reconstruct the table by more than one ways, you should output one line contains only: &quot;So young!&quot;, otherwise (only one way to reconstruct the table) you should output: &quot;So simple!&quot;.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n1 1\n5\n5\n2 2\n0 10\n0 10\n2 2\n2 2\n2 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: So simple!\nCase #2: So naive!\nCase #3: So young!</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"BJTU","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2014+Multi-University+Training+Contest+10&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2014 Multi-University Training Contest 10 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
