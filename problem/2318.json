The player advances to later levels (with correspondingly higher numbers of atoms and lives) by containing the atoms in progressively smaller spaces, until at least 75% of the area is blocked off.&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; (wikipedia.org)<br>The picture to the right is a screenshot from the original game, where the player has already covered some space (the black part). In this problem we will consider a slightly different, non-discrete, version of the game. That is, while the length unit is still pixels, you should treat them as non-discrete in the sense that all objects can be at non-integer coordinates and all movements are continuous.<br><br>The size of the playing field will be 1024 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 768 pixels. The atoms that bounce around will be infinitely thin (and not round balls like in the screenshot). The atoms will move at a constant speed and only change direction when hitting the edge of the playing field (x-coordinate 0 and 1024 or y-coordinate 0 and 768), where they bounce without loss of energy. The atoms do not hit each other.<br><br>The player can divide the playing field in two by shooting a horizontal or vertical ray from (in this problem) a fixed point on the playing field. The ray will then extend in both directions simultaneously (up and down for vertical rays, or left and right for horizontal rays) at a uniform speed (in this problem always 200 pixels per second). The rays will also be infinitely thin. If no atom touches any part of the ray while it&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s still being extended, the field has successfully been divided. Otherwise the player loses a life.<br><br>If an atom touches the endpoint of an extending edge, this will not be counted as a hit. Also, if an atom hits the ray at the same instant it has finished extending, this will also not count as a hit. Write a program that determines the minimum time the player must wait before he can start extending a ray so that an atom will not hit it before the ray has been completed.<br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/3031_1.png\"><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Each test case starts with a line containing a single integer n, the number of atoms (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; n &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 10). Then follows a line containing two integers, x and y, the position where the two ray ends will start extending from (0 &lt; x &lt; 1024, 0 &lt; y &lt; 768). Then n lines follow, each containing four integers, x, y, vx and vy describing the initial position and speed of an atom (0 &lt; x &lt; 1024, 0 &lt; y &lt; 768, 1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; |vx| &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 200, 1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; |vy| &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 200). The speed of the atom in the x direction is given by vx, and the speed in the y direction is given by vy. All positions in each input will be distinct. The input is terminated by a case where n = 0, which should not be processed. There will be at most 25 test cases.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output the minimum time (with exactly 5 decimal digits) until the player can extend either a horizontal or vertical ray without an atom colliding with it while it is being drawn.
