The standard algorithm is too hard for him to understand, so he (and you) only considers those submatrixes with exactly $m$ columns.<br>It is much easier now. But Little Q always thinks the answer is too small. So he decides to reset no more than $A$ cells&apos; value to $0$, and choose no more than $B$ disjoint submatrixes to achieve the maximum sum. Two submatrix are considered disjoint only if they do not share any common cell.<br>Please write a program to help Little Q find the maximum sum. Note that he can choose nothing so the answer is always non-negative.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T(1\\leq T\\leq10)$, denoting the number of test cases.<br>In each test case, there are $4$ integers $n,m,A,B(1\\leq n\\leq 100,1\\leq m\\leq 3000,0\\leq A\\leq 10000,1\\leq B\\leq 3)$.<br>Each of the following $n$ lines contains $m$ integers, the $j$-th number on the $i$-th of these lines is $w_{i,j}(|w_{i,j}|\\leq 10^9)$, denoting the value of each cell.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print a single line containing an integer, denoting the maximum sum.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n5 1 0 1\n3\n-1\n5\n-1\n-2\n5 1 1 1\n3\n-1\n5\n-1\n-2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">7\n8</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2018+Multi-University+Training+Contest+3&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2018 Multi-University Training Contest 3 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
