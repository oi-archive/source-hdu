She has N vases numbered from 0 to N-1. When she receive some flowers, she will try to put them in the vases, one flower in one vase. She randomly choose the vase A and try to put a flower in the vase. If the there is no flower in the vase, she will put a flower in it, otherwise she skip this vase. And then she will try put in the vase A+1, A+2, ..., N-1, until there is no flower left or she has tried the vase N-1. The left flowers will be discarded. Of course, sometimes she will clean the vases. Because there are too many vases, she randomly choose to clean the vases numbered from A to B(A &lt;= B). The flowers in the cleaned vases will be discarded.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;The first line contains an integer T, indicating the number of test cases.<br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;For each test case, the first line contains two integers N(1 &lt; N &lt; 50001) and M(1 &lt; M &lt; 50001). N is the number of vases, and M is the operations of Alice. Each of the next M lines contains three integers. The first integer of one line is K(1 or 2). If K is 1, then two integers A and F follow. It means Alice receive F flowers and try to put a flower in the vase A first. If K is 2, then two integers A and B follow. It means the owner would like to clean the vases numbered from A to B(A &lt;= B).","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;For each operation of which K is 1, output the position of the vase in which Alice put the first flower and last one, separated by a blank.
