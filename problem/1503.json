Most times this method doesn&apos;t work, but sometimes, in very rare cases, a new fruit emerges that tastes like a mixture between both of them. <br>A big topic of discussion inside the company is &quot;How should the new creations be called?&quot; A mixture between an apple and a pear could be called an apple-pear, of course, but this doesn&apos;t sound very interesting. The boss finally decides to use the shortest string that contains both names of the original fruits as sub-strings as the new name. For instance, &quot;applear&quot; contains &quot;apple&quot; and &quot;pear&quot; (APPLEar and apPlEAR), and there is no shorter string that has the same property. <br><br>A combination of a cranberry and a boysenberry would therefore be called a &quot;boysecranberry&quot; or a &quot;craboysenberry&quot;, for example. <br><br>Your job is to write a program that computes such a shortest name for a combination of two given fruits. Your algorithm should be efficient, otherwise it is unlikely that it will execute in the alloted time for long fruit names. <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Each line of the input contains two strings that represent the names of the fruits that should be combined.
