I am the Prime minister, you know!<br>&#x2014;I know, so therefore your new number 8179 is also a prime. You will just have to paste four new digits over the four old ones on your office door.<br>&#x2014; No, it&#x2019;s not that simple. Suppose that I change the first digit to an 8, then the number will read 8033 which is not a prime!<br>&#x2014; I see, being the prime minister you cannot stand having a non-prime number on your door even for a few seconds.<br>&#x2014; Correct! So I must invent a scheme for going from 1033 to 8179 by a path of prime numbers where only one digit is changed from one prime to the next prime.<br><br>Now, the minister of finance, who had been eavesdropping, intervened.<br>&#x2014; No unnecessary expenditure, please! I happen to know that the price of a digit is one pound.<br>&#x2014; Hmm, in that case I need a computer program to minimize the cost. You don&#x2019;t know some very cheap software gurus, do you?<br>&#x2014;In fact, I do. You see, there is this programming contest going on. . .<br><br>Help the prime minister to find the cheapest prime path between any two given four-digit primes! The first digit must be nonzero, of course. Here is a solution in the case above.<br>1033<br>1733<br>3733<br>3739<br>3779<br>8779<br>8179<br>The cost of this solution is 6 pounds. Note that the digit 1 which got pasted over in step 2 can not be reused in the last step &#x2013; a new 1 must be purchased.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"One line with a positive number: the number of test cases (at most 100).
