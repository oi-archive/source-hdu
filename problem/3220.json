This hypercube has 16 vertices, numbered from 1 to 16, as illustrated below. On every vertex, there is a light bulb that can be turned on or off. Initially, eight of the light bulbs are turned on and the other eight are turned off. You are allowed to switch the states of two adjacent light bulbs with different states (&#x201C;on&#x201D; to &#x201C;off&#x201D;, and &#x201C;off&#x201D; to &#x201C;on&#x201D;; specifically, swap their states) in one operation.<br><br>Given the initial state of the lights, your task is to calculate the minimum number of steps needed to achieve the target state, in which the light bulbs on the sub cube (1,2,3,4)-(5,6,7,8) are turned off, and the rest of them are turned on.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
