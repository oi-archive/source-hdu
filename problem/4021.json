There are 24 possible positions in total, so one of them is not occupied by the tile. We can denote the empty position by zero.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Daniel could move the tiles to the empty position if the tile is on the top, bottom, left or right of the empty position. In this way Daniel can reorder the tiles on the board.<br>Usually he plays with this game by setting up a target states initially, and then trying to do a series of moves to achieve the target. Soon he finds that not all target states could be achieved.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;He asks for your help, to determine whether he has set up an impossible target or not.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains an integer denoting the number of test cases.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;For each test case, the first line contains 24 integers denoting the initial states of the game board.
