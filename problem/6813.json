She has brought a huge birthday cake and some powerful tomatoes, and has decorated almost every corner of the classroom. However, the blackboard is still empty. The last thing to do is to draw a beautiful pattern on it.<br><br>The blackboard is regarded as an infinite plane, each integer point $(x, y)$ has an integer value as its color. At the very beginning, the color of every point is $0$.<br><br>Zhang3 has $n$ crayons, labeled $1, 2, \\ldots, n$. Painting with the $i ^ \\mathrm{th}$ crayon, you can replace the color of some chosen integer point $(x, y)$ with color $i$. It is called a step, and she will draw the pattern step by step.<br><br>According to Zhang3&apos;s judgement of beautiful patterns, there&apos;s a restriction: Just before you paint $(x, y)$ into some color $i$, the last four colors of $i$ must appear among the adjacent points of $(x, y)$. The last four colors of $i$ means colors from $(i - 4)$ to $(i - 1)$, ignoring those non-positive ones. Two integer points are adjacent if their Euclid distance is exactly one. (Note that a point is not adjacent to itself.) If the condition above is not satisfied, the step is not allowed.<br><br>Zhang3 doesn&apos;t want to waste crayons, so the final pattern should contain at least one point with color $n$. Please help her find a way to draw such a beautiful pattern.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The only line of the input contains an integer $n \\; (1 \\le n \\le 100)$, the number of crayons.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Print the steps in chronological order, each in a separate line.
