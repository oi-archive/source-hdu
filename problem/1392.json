A peasant wants to buy a rope to surround all these trees. So at first he must know the minimal required length of the rope. However, he does not know how to calculate it. Can you help him? <br>The diameter and length of the trees are omitted, which means a tree can be seen as a point. The thickness of the rope is also omitted which means a rope can be seen as a line.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1392-1.gif\"></center><br><br>There are no more than 100 trees.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains one or more data sets.
