But the game we play here is rather easy. It just contains three suits: stones, bamboos and characters.<br>Stones consist of a number of circles. Each circle is said to represent can (&#x7B52;, t&#xF3;ng) coins with a square hole in the middle.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/3391-1.png\"></center> <br>Bamboos consist of a number of bamboo sticks. Each stick is said to represent a string (&#x7D22;, su&#x1D2;) that holds a hundred coins. Note that 1 Bamboo is an exception: it has a bird sitting on a bamboo, to prevent alteration.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/3391-2.png\"></center> <br>Each character represents ten thousand (&#x842C;, w&#xE0;n) coins.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/3391-3.png\"></center> <br>A player wins the round by creating a standard mahjong hand, which consists of a certain number of melds (namely, four for 13-tile variations) and a pair. A meld is three tiles which are adjacent in one suit or all the same. A pair is two same tiles.<br>Now one player has three tiles in hand. Can you tell what more tile he need to win?<br>Note that the number of each tile in Mahjong is four. So if the number of one tile the player has is four, he cannot get this tile anymore.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains one integer T indicating the number of test cases.<br>For each case, there are thirteen tiles in one line, separated by one space.<br>Each tile has two characters.
