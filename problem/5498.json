He is playing a game with $q$ rounds. In each round, he randomly chooses an edge from the graph. After $q$ rounds, he removes the duplicated edges. If the remaining edges form a tree, soda wins the game.<br><br>soda wants to know the number of different ways to choose edge in each round that will make him win the game.<br><br>As the answer will be very large, soda gives you another integer $p$. You should print the answer modulo $p$.<br><br>Note that two ways are considered different if at least in one round soda chooses different edges.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
