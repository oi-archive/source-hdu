One day, he comes up with a counting problem:<br>You are given two strings $a,b$ which consist of only lowercase English letters. You can subtract a substring $x$ (maybe empty) from string $a$ and a substring $y$ (also maybe empty) from string $b$, and then connect them as $x+y$ with $x$ at the front and $y$ at the back. In this way, a series of new strings can be obtained.<br>The question is how many different new strings can be obtained in this way.<br>Two strings are different, if and only if they have different lengths or there exists an integer $i$ such that the two strings have different characters at position $i$.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input is a single integer $T~(T&#x2264;5)$, indicating the number of testcases. <br>For each test case, there are two lines, the first line is string $a$, and the second line is string $b$. $1&lt;=|a|,|b|&lt;=90000$.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one line, a single integer indicating the answer.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\nacbcc\ncccabc\nbbbabbababbababbaaaabbbbabbaaaabaabbabbabbbaaabaab\nabbaabbabbaaaabbbaababbabbabababaaaaabbaabbaabbaab</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">135\n557539</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Author","content":"SXYZ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2015+Multi-University+Training+Contest+5&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2015 Multi-University Training Contest 5 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
