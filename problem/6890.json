In Baby Volcano&apos;s school,there are $n$ cabinets in a row,numbered by $1$ to $n$. The distance between two adjacent cabinets is $1$, and the entrance is at the cabinet $1$. Among all $n$ cabinets,the one numbered $k$ is special and it is used to enter the code and open the cabinet door.<br><br>Baby Volcano has $m$ express mails to take,the $i$-th is in the cabinet $a_i$.<br>Two express mails will not be stored in the same cabinet. Also there is no express mail in the cabinet $k$.<br><br>To prevent expresses from being stolen, Baby Volcano have to take these express mails one by one, starting at the entrance. Generally, if he wants to take the express mail $i$, he have to walk to cabinet $k$ first to enter the code, and then walks to cabinet $a_i$. After taking the last one,he walks to the entrance.<br><br>There are so many express mails to take, so Baby Volcano wants to find a taking order which minimize the distance he walks.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains one integer $T(1 \\le T \\le 100)$,the number of testcases.<br><br>For each test cases,the first line contains three integer $n,m,k(1 \\le k \\le n \\le 10^9,1 \\le m &lt; \\min(n,10^6))$<br><br>The next line contains $m$ integer,the $i$-th stand for $a_i(1 \\le a_i \\le n,a_i \\neq k)$.<br><br>The input guarantees that $\\sum m \\le 2 \\times 10^6$<br><br>**Note:Because of the large input,it is prefered to use scanf instead of cin.**","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case,Output a single line contains one integer,representing for the minimal walking distance.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n10 2 5\n6 7\n10 2 5\n3 4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">14\n10</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2020%D6%D0%B9%FA%B4%F3%D1%A7%C9%FA%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%BE%BA%C8%FC%A3%A8CCPC%A3%A9+-+%CD%F8%C2%E7%D1%A1%B0%CE%C8%FC&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2020&#xFFFD;&#x439;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x467;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x1BE;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;CCPC&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; - &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x461;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
