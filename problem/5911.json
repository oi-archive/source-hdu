In each test case:<br><br>The first line contains a vector S, the initial position of Hanzo&#x2019;s arrow.<br><br>The second line contains two positive integers l and r, which means that Hanzo&#x2019;s arrow can be recognized as a cylinder with a radius of r and a height of 2l. We always use the position of the centroid of the cylinder to indicate the position of the cylinder. Initially the centroid is at S.<br><br>The third line contains a vector V , the initial velocity of Hanzo&#x2019;s arrow.<br><br>The fourth line contains a vector G(|G| &gt; 0), the acceleration of gravity. The position of the centroid of the cylinder moves according to V and G. When the arrow is flying, the line connecting the centers of the two circles&#x2019; surfaces of the cylinder is always the tangent line to the trajectory of the centroid at the point of the centroid. (Consider yourself throwing a telegraph pole if you don&#x2019;t understand the movement of the arrow.)<br><br>And the last line contains a vector D, the position of Genji&#x2019;s head. We consider Genji&#x2019;s head as a single point. The arrow hits his head when D is on the surface or in the cylinder.<br><br>Initially, D has no intersection with the cylinder. It is guaranteed that if the arrow will not hit Genji&#x2019;s head, the distance between Genji&#x2019;s head and the arrow will always be no less than $10^{-6}$. All the vectors are represented by three numbers which are the three-dimensional cartesion coordinates of that vector.<br><br>All the input numbers are integers and their absolute values are bounded by 1000, except for the number of test cases T.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output whether the arrow will hit Genji&#x2019;s head.
