The two hands form an angle. The angle is measured as the smallest angle between the two hands. The angle between the two hands has a measure that is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 180 degrees.<br><br>Given a sequence of five distinct times written in the format hh : mm , where hh are two digits representing full hours (00 &lt;= hh &lt;= 23) and mm are two digits representing minutes (00 &lt;= mm &lt;= 59) , you are to write a program that finds the median, that is, the third element of the sorted sequence of times in a nondecreasing order of their associated angles. Ties are broken in such a way that an earlier time precedes a later time.<br><br>For example, suppose you are given a sequence (06:05, 07:10, 03:00, 21:00, 12:55) of times. Because the sorted sequence is (12:55, 03:00, 21:00, 06:05, 07:10), you are to report 21:00.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of T test cases.
