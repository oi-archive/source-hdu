Initially, i.e. at time 0, the i-th value of the array is Ai. After t (t is a non-negative integer) time units, it will be increased by t*Bi.<br>You are also given N integers Pi, and the beauty of the array is simply defined as A1 mod P1 + A2 mod P2 + &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; + AN mod PN. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array. You have T time units.<br>Your task is to calculate the maximum beauty of the array in T time units and when you can get the maximum beauty. More formally, you have to find the maximum value of (A1+t*B1) mod P1 + (A2+t*B2) mod P2 + &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; + (AN + t*BN) mod PN, where t is a non-negative integer in [0, T], and also t which gives maximum value.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases. Please process till EOF (end of file).<br>The 1st line of each test case contains 2 integers N and T. In the 2nd line, there are N space-separated integers A1, A2, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; , AN. The next line also contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; , BN. Then the last line of each test case contains N space-separated integers P1, P2, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; , PN. <br>1&lt;=N, T&lt;=100000.<br>For all i (1 &lt;= i &lt;= N), 0 &lt;= Ai, Bi &lt; Pi, 5*10^8 &lt; Pi &lt; 10^9.<br>For simplicity, all Pi are prime.<br>All Ai, Bi are randomly and uniformly generated between [0, Pi).<br>The sum of all N will not exceed 1000000.<br>The number of test cases is smaller than 250.
