But there always exists a big problem: every kid in this game want to play the role of Hawk.  <br>So the teacher came up with an idea: Vote. Every child have some nice handkerchiefs, and if he/she think someone is suitable for the role of Hawk, he/she gives a handkerchief to this kid, which means this kid who is given the handkerchief win the support. Note the support can be transmitted. Kids who get the most supports win in the vote and able to play the role of Hawk.(A note:if A can win<br>support from B(A != B) A can win only one support from B in any case the number of the supports transmitted from B to A are many. And A can&apos;t win the support from himself in any case.<br>If two or more kids own the same number of support from others, we treat all of them as winner.<br>Here&apos;s a sample: 3 kids A, B and C, A gives a handkerchief to B, B gives a handkerchief to C, so C wins 2 supports and he is choosen to be the Hawk.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases.
