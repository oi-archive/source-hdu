To protect desolator himself from the harm of radiation, the Desolator wears an armored Radiation suit. This suit is protected against the radiation emitted by the cannon. <br>There are N enemies need to be destroyed. Each enemy can be destroyed if their total attacked times reach a certain value. Fortunately we know that value for each enemy. <br>Our honored desolator FreeRadiant is executing this mission. He can use his cannon freely: e.g. plant it somewhere, wait for some time, uproot it and plant it somewhere else again and so on. The Desolator is so fast that planting, uprooting and moving the cannon takes no time, only the poisoning time matters. He just wants to know the total time needed in which he has to plant the cannon into the ground.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line consists of an integer of T, indicating the test cases in the file.<br>Each case begins with two integers, N and R, indicating the number of enemies and the radius of the circle.
