Imagine the board is a rectangle, consists of several square grids. He  drew  diagonally, so there are two kinds of draws, one is like &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;\\&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; , the other is like &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;/&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;. In each draw he choose arbitrary number of grids to draw. He always drew the first kind in red color, and drew the other kind in blue color, when a grid is drew by both red and blue, it becomes green. A grid will never be drew by the same color more than one time. Now give you the ultimate state of the board, can you calculate the minimum time of draws to reach this state.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is an integer T describe the number of test cases.<br>Each test case begins with an integer number n describe the number of rows of the drawing board.<br>Then n lines of string consist of &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;R&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;B&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;G&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; and &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;.&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; of the same length. &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;.&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; means  the grid has not been drawn.<br>1&lt;=n&lt;=50<br>The number of column of the rectangle is also less than 50.<br>Output<br>Output an integer as described in the problem description.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Output an integer as described in the problem description.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n4\nRR.B\n.RG.\n.BRR\nB..R\n4\nRRBB\nRGGB\nBGGR\nBBRR</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n6</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"ZSTU","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2015+Multi-University+Training+Contest+3&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2015 Multi-University Training Contest 3 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
