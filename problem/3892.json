An interesting issue would be to determine whether they have some roots in common. Notice roots we mention here are integers in modulo p system (0 &lt;= root &lt; p). Moreover, if the given polynomial is of order r, we will guarantee that it has r roots.<br>For example, we have<br>x^2 + 13x + 36 (mod 37)<br>x^3 + 14x^2 + 49x + 36 (mod 37)<br>If x = 33 or x = 28, both of them would give the value of 0. So 33 and 28 are the roots in common.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are many test cases (less than1000).<br>In each case, the integer in the first line is n (the number of polynomials in this case). Then n lines followed. Each of them starts with an integer r (order of polynomials, r &lt;= 50), and r + 1 integers (a(r), a(r-1) ,..., a(0)), which means the polynomial goes like:<br>a(r) * x^r + a(r-1) * x^(r-1) + &#x2026; +a(1) * x + a(0) (mod 999983).<br>To make it easier, p is set to be 999983, as you see.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each case, just output &#x201C;YES&#x201D; if they have common roots, otherwise &#x201C;NO&#x201D; in a single line.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n2 1 13 36\n3 1 14 49 36</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">YES</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2011+Multi-University+Training+Contest+6+-+Host+by+JLU&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2011 Multi-University Training Contest 6 - Host by JLU </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
