Fibonacci&apos;s 1202 book Liber Abaci introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics, although the sequence had been previously described in Indian mathematics.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;The first number of the sequence is 0, the second number is 1, and each subsequent number is equal to the sum of the previous two numbers of the sequence itself, yielding the sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc. In mathematical terms, it is defined by the following recurrence relation:<br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/data/images/C190-1006-1.png\"><br>That is, after two starting values, each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The first Fibonacci numbers (sequence A000045 in OEIS), also denoted as F[n]; <br>F[n] can be calculate exactly by the following two expressions:<br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/data/images/C190-1006-2.jpg\"><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/data/images/C190-1006-3.jpg\"><br>A Fibonacci spiral created by drawing arcs connecting the opposite corners of squares in the Fibonacci tiling; this one uses squares of sizes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34;<br><br>So you can see how interesting the Fibonacci number is.<br>Now AekdyCoin denote a function G(n)<br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/data/images/C190-1006-5.jpg\"><br>Now your task is quite easy, just help AekdyCoin to calculate the value of G (n) mod C","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of T test cases.
