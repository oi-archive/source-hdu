Moreover, 23 is the biggest summation one can get from this kind of arraignment of digits. Your task is even tougher, given a positive integer n, you should use integer from 1 to 3*(n-1) to construct triangle with equal summation of digits on the three edges and the summation is the biggest among all the possible arraignments. For example, if n = 4, then you should choose number from 1 to 3*(4-1).<br>For convenience, the output format for a certain triangle is like the example for the figured triangle above:<br>95 41 38 2 6 7<br>The numbers are separated by a single space in each row, and there are no spaces at the end of each row.<br>Note that there may be several solutions exist, arbitrary one of them will be accepted.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains a number t indicates the number of test cases.&#xA0;&#xA0;Following t lines, each line will contains only one integer n denoting the side length of the desired triangle.
