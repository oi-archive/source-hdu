Then, he colors all the vertices black or white. Finally, he wants to use the following operation to make the vertices correctly colored: choose two adjacent vertices and swap their colors. The vertices are correctly colored if and only if no two adjacent vertices share the same color.<br><br>Professor Zhang wants to know the minimum number of operations needed.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
