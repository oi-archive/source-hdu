As you may know, POM is famous for her second skill &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Elune&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s Arrow&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, which allows POM to fire a fast magic arrow to deal large damage to the enemy unit. In fact, POM&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s arrow always flies in a straight line and disappear after hitting an enemy unit.<br><br>Littlepig&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s POM was hiding in the forest and intended to shoot a certain important target on the lane. There were also several other enemy units nearby. POM&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s arrow might fly in a wrong direction and miss the target, or even if the arrow flew straight to the target, it still could be blocked by other enemy units and couldn&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t reach the target. So given a flying direction, your job is to determine whether Littlepig&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s arrow would hit his target.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases, and each test case is given in the following format:<br>The first line contains an integer n (0 &lt;n&lt;=5), indicating the number of enemy units in the game.<br>The second line are two integers (x0,y0) representing the position where POM stands.<br>The third line gives a vector (dx,dy) describing the flying direction of the arrow.<br>Then n lines follows, each describing an enemy unit. An enemy unit can be considered as a convex polygon and the polygon is given in the following format in a line:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;m x1 y1 x2 y2&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;xm ym<br>m is the number of vertices(m&lt;=10), and (x1,y1)&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;(xm,ym) are the vertices coordinates of the polygon, given in counter-clockwise order. <br>The first enemy unit is the POM&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s target.<br><br>The input ends with a zero in a separate line (n=0).
