The indepence is defined that if there exist two roads which are made up of enterprises(Vertexs) and their financial trade relations(Edge) has the common start point S and end point T, and expect S and T, none of other enterprise in two chains is included in these two roads at the same time. So that if one of enterpirse bankrupt in one of road, the other will not be obstructed.<br><br>Now there are N enterprises, and have M pair of financial trade relations between them, the relations are Mutual. They need to ask about Q pairs of enterprises&apos; safety situations. When two enterprises have two or more independent financial chains, we say they are safe enough, you needn&apos;t provide exact answers.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The Input consists of multiple test cases.
