He wants to take part in the game. But as we all know, you can&apos;t get good result without teammates.<br>So, he needs to select two classmates as his teammates. <br>In this game, the IQ is very important, if you have low IQ you will WanTuo. Dudu&apos;s IQ is a given number k. We use an integer v[i] to represent the IQ of the ith classmate. <br>The sum of new two teammates&apos; IQ must more than Dudu&apos;s IQ.<br>For some reason, Dudu don&apos;t want the two teammates comes from the same class.<br>Now, give you the status of classes, can you tell Dudu how many ways there are.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There is a number T shows there are T test cases below.
