Zhang3 wants to make a cube as a new head for him.<br><br>Zhang3 got a piece of grid paper as material, satisfying the conditions below:<br><br>- The grid paper consists of $n \\times m$ square units, forming $n$ rows by $m$ columns.<br>- Some units of the grid paper are broken, the others are usable.<br>- All of the usable units are 4-connected (two units are directly connected by sharing an edge).<br><br>By using some tools, she can do the following things for arbitrary times:<br><br>- Cut along an edge on the grid paper. After doing this, the paper mustn&apos;t be split into two pieces, i.e., all the usable units are still 4-connected.<br>- Fold along an edge, so that the two adjacent units form a right angle.<br><br>A cube has six faces. Every unit should overlap with one of the six faces. The paper is so thin that it&apos;s possible to overlap more than one units at the same face. But it&apos;s not allowed to leave a face without any units.<br><br>Help Zhang3 determine whether it is possible to make a cube with the grid paper.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input gives the number of test cases,  $T \\; (1 \\le T \\le 100)$. $T$ test cases follow.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains two integers $n, m \\; (1 \\le n,m \\le 6)$, the size of the grid paper. <br><br>Then $n$ lines follow, each contains a string of length $m$, describing the grid.
