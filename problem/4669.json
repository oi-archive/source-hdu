There is a number on each jewel. Now Tom wants to select a wonderful chain from the necklace. A chain will be regarded wonderful if the wonderful value of the chain is a multiple of a key number K. Tom gets the wonderful value using this way&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;He writes down the number on the chain in clockwise order and concatenates them together. In this way, he gets a decimal number which is defined as the wonderful value.<br>For example, consider a necklace with 5 jewels and corresponding numbers on the jewels are 9 6 4 2 8 (9 and 8 are in neighborhood). Assume we take K=7, then we can find that only five chains can be multiples of K. They are 42, 28, 896, 42896 and 89642.<br><br>Now Tom wants to know that how many ways he can follow to select a wonderful chain from his necklace.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases, terminated by EOF.<br>Each case begins with two integers n( 1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; n &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 50000), K(1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; K &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 200),the length of the necklace and the key number.<br>The second line consists of n integer numbers, the i-th number a<sub>i</sub>(1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; a<sub>i</sub> &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 1000) indicating the number on the ith jewel.
