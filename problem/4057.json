There is no doubt that Dr. X had a in-depth research on the rabbits&apos; genes. He found that if a rabbit gene contained a particular gene segment, we could consider it as a good rabbit, or sometimes a bad rabbit. And we use a value W to measure this index.<br><br>We can make a example, if a rabbit has gene segment &quot;ATG&quot;, its W would plus 4; and if has gene segment &quot;TGC&quot;, its W plus -3. So if a rabbit&apos;s gene string is &quot;ATGC&quot;, its W is 1 due to ATGC contains both &quot;ATG&quot;(+4) and &quot;TGC&quot;(-3). And if another rabbit&apos;s gene string is &quot;ATGATG&quot;, its W is 4 due to one gene segment can be calculate only once.<br><br>Because there are enough rabbits on Earth before 2012, so we can assume we can get any genes with different structure. Now Dr. X want to find a rabbit whose gene has highest W value. There are so many different genes with length l, and Dr. X is not good at programming, can you help him to figure out the W value of the best rabbit.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
