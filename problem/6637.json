There are $n$ problems in the online judge, labeled by $1,2,\\dots,n$.<br><br>For the $i$-th problem, Sunset needs to code $a_i$ bytes while Elephant needs to code $b_i$ bytes. But they can work on problems together. Specifically, for the $i$-th problem, they can choose a real number $x_i(0\\leq x_i\\leq 1)$, split this problem into two parts $A$ and $B$, then assign Sunset to code part $A$ and assign Elephant to code part $B$. As a result, Sunset will code $a_i\\times x_i$ bytes, and Elephant will code $b_i\\times(1-x_i)$ bytes.<br><br>Now they want to solve all the problems whose labels are not larger than $k$. Assume Sunset codes $X$ bytes in total and Elephant codes $Y$ bytes in total. It is too tired for a coder to code too much code. Please help them find an assignment that $\\max(X,Y)$ is minimized.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T(1\\leq T\\leq 10000)$, denoting the number of test cases.<br><br>In each test case, there is one integer $n(1\\leq n\\leq 250000)$ in the first line, denoting the number of problems.<br><br>For the next $n$ lines, each line contains two integers $a_i,b_i(1\\leq a_i,b_i\\leq 1000)$, denoting each problem.<br><br>It is guaranteed that $\\sum n\\leq 10^6$.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print $n$ lines in format $\\texttt{u/v}$, where the $i$-th line denotes the minimum value of $\\max(X,Y)$ when $k=i$.
