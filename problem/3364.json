The present contains n lanterns and m switches. Each switch controls some lanterns and pushing the switch will change the state of all lanterns it controls from off to on or from on to off. A lantern may be controlled by many switches. At the beginning, all the lanterns are off. <br><br>Alice wants to change the state of the lanterns to some specific configurations and she knows that pushing a switch more than once is pointless. Help Alice to find out the number of ways she can achieve the goal. Two ways are different if and only if the sets (including the empty set) of the switches been pushed are different.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer T (T&lt;=5) indicating the number of test cases.<br>The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1&lt;=n&lt;=50) and m (1&lt;=m&lt;=50).<br>Then m lines follow.
