In other words, an alkane consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in a tree structure in which all the carbon-carbon bonds are single. Alkanes have the general chemical formula CnH2n+2. <br>    In an alkane, each carbon atom has 4 bonds (either C-C or C-H), and each hydrogen atom is joined to one of the carbon atoms (so in a C-H bond). The number of carbon<br>atoms may be thought of as the size of the alkane.<br>    Alkanes with more than 3 carbon atoms can be arranged in various different ways, forming structural isomers. The simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches. This isomer is sometimes called the n-isomer. However the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points. The number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms.<br>    Moreover, we define an alkyl is an alkane missing one hydrogen. An acyclic alkyl has the general formula CnH2n+1. The defination of structural isomer of alkyls is similar to alkanes&#x2019;.<br>    Now you need to count the number of structural isomers of alkanes and alkyls of size n modulo 998244353.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"    The first line of the input contains an integer T , denoting the number of test cases.<br>    In each test case, there is a single integer n in one line, denoting the size of alkanes and alkyls.<br>1 &#x2264; T &#x2264; 100000, 1 &#x2264; n &#x2264; 100000","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"    For each test case, output one line contains two integers, denoting the number of structural isomers of alkanes and alkyls of size n modulo 998244353.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">9\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1 1\n1 1\n1 2\n2 4\n3 8\n5 17\n9 39\n18 89\n35 211\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\n<center><img src=\"../../data/images/C717-1001-2.jpg\"></center>\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2018+Multi-University+Training+Contest+10&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2018 Multi-University Training Contest 10 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
