The ICPC people recently proposed an interesting sequence at ACM2016 and encountered a problem needed to be solved.<br><br>The sequence is generated by the following scheme.<br>   1. First, write down 1, 2 on a paper.<br>   2. The 2nd number is 2, write down 2 2&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s (including the one originally on the paper). The paper thus has 1, 2, 2 written on it.<br>   3. The 3rd number is 2, write down 2 3&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s.  1, 2, 2, 3, 3 is now shown on the paper.<br>   4. The 4th number is 3, write down 3 4&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s.  1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4 is now shown on the paper.<br>   5. The procedure continues indefinitely as you can imagine. 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, . . . .<br><br>The ICPC is widely renowned for its counting ability. At ACM2016, they came up with all sorts of intriguing problems in regard to this sequence, and here is one: Given a positive number $n$, First of all, find out the position of the last $n$ that appeared in the sequence. For instance, the position of the last 3 is 5, the position of the last 4 is 8. After obtaining the position, do the same again: Find out the position of the last (position number). For instance, the position of the last 3 is 5, and the position of the last 5 is 11. ICPC would like you to help them tackle such problems efficiently.<br> <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a positive integer $T, T \\leq 2000$, indicating the number of queries to follow.
