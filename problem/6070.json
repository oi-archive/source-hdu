First let&apos;s ignore all the problems the team didn&apos;t pass, assume the team passed $X$ problems during the contest, and submitted $Y$ times for these problems, then the &apos;&apos;Dirt Ratio&apos;&apos; is measured as $\\frac{X}{Y}$. If the &apos;&apos;Dirt Ratio&apos;&apos; of a team is too low, the team tends to cause more penalty, which is not a good performance.<br><br><center><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C762-1004-1.jpg\"><br>Picture from MyICPC<br></center><br><br>Little Q is a coach, he is now staring at the submission list of a team. You can assume all the problems occurred in the list was solved by the team during the contest. Little Q calculated the team&apos;s low &apos;&apos;Dirt Ratio&apos;&apos;, felt very angry. He wants to have a talk with them. To make the problem more serious, he wants to choose a continuous subsequence of the list, and then calculate the &apos;&apos;Dirt Ratio&apos;&apos; just based on that subsequence.<br><br>Please write a program to find such subsequence having the lowest &apos;&apos;Dirt Ratio&apos;&apos;.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T(1\\leq T\\leq15)$, denoting the number of test cases.<br><br>In each test case, there is an integer $n(1\\leq n\\leq 60000)$ in the first line, denoting the length of the submission list.<br><br>In the next line, there are $n$ positive integers $a_1,a_2,...,a_n(1\\leq a_i\\leq n)$, denoting the problem ID of each submission.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print a single line containing a floating number, denoting the lowest &apos;&apos;Dirt Ratio&apos;&apos;.
