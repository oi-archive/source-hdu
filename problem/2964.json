That is, we can write<br><br>    n = a0 + a1*b + a2*b*b + a3*b*b*b + ... <br><br>where the coefficients a0, a1, a2, a3, ... are between 0 and b-1 (inclusive).<br><br>What is less well known is that if p0, p1, p2, ... are the first primes (starting from 2, 3, 5, ...), every positive integer n can be represented uniquely in the &quot;mixed&quot; bases as:<br><br>    n = a0 + a1*p0 + a2*p0*p1 + a3*p0*p1*p2 + ... <br><br>where each coefficient ai is between 0 and pi-1 (inclusive). Notice that, for example, a3 is between 0 and p3-1, even though p3 may not be needed explicitly to represent the integer n.<br><br>Given a positive integer n, you are asked to write n in the representation above. Do not use more primes than it is needed to represent n, and omit all terms in which the coefficient is 0.
