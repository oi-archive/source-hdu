Maybe he thinks it is the best way to show he is alone without a girl friend. The day 2011.11.11 comes. Seeing classmates walking with their girl friends, he coundn&apos;t help running into his classroom, and then opened his maths book preparing to count odd numbers. He looked at his book, then he found a question &quot;C<sub>(n,0)</sub>+C<sub>(n,1)</sub>+C<sub>(n,2)</sub>+...+C<sub>(n,n)</sub>=?&quot;. Of course, Xiao Ming knew the answer, but he didn&apos;t care about that , What he wanted to know was that how many odd numbers there were? Then he began to count odd numbers. When n is equal to 1, C<sub>(1,0)</sub>=C<sub>(1,1)</sub>=1, there are 2 odd numbers. When n is equal to 2, C<sub>(2,0)</sub>=C<sub>(2,2)</sub>=1, there are 2 odd numbers...... Suddenly, he found a girl was watching him counting odd numbers. In order to show his gifts on maths, he wrote several big numbers what n would be equal to, but he found it was impossible to finished his tasks, then he sent a piece of information to you, and wanted you a excellent programmer to help him, he really didn&apos;t want to let her down. Can you help him?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Each line contains a integer n(1&lt;=n&lt;=10<sup>8</sup>)","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"A single line with the number of odd numbers of C<sub>(n,0)</sub>,C<sub>(n,1)</sub>,C<sub>(n,2)</sub>...C<sub>(n,n)</sub>.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n2\n11</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n2\n8</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"HIT","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2012+Multi-University+Training+Contest+5&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2012 Multi-University Training Contest 5 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
