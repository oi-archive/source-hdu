A dream architect is responsible for crafting the virtual world that the team and the target will dream into. To avoid the target noticing the world is artificial, a dream architect must have powerful 3D imagination.<br><br>Cobb uses a simple 3D imagination game to test whether a candidate has the potential to be an dream architect. He lets the candidate imagine a cube consisting of n&#xD7;n&#xD7;n blocks in a 3D coordinate system as Figure 1. The block at bottom left front corner is marked (1, 1, 1) and the diagonally opposite block is marked (n, n, n). Then he tells the candidate that the blocks on a certain line are eliminated. The line is always parallel to an axis. After m such block eliminations, the candidate is asked to tell how many blocks are eliminated. Note that one block can only be eliminated once even if it is on multiple lines.<br><br>Here is a sample graph according to the first test case in the sample input:<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/3682-1.gif\"></center> <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is the number of test cases.<br>In each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m( 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000, 0 &lt;= m &lt;= 1000).&#xFF0C;meaning that the cube is n x n x n and there are m eliminations.<br><br>Each of the following m lines represents an elimination in the following format:<br>axis_1=a, axis_2=b<br>where axis_i (i=1, 2) is &#x2018;X&#x2019; or &#x2018;Y&#x2019;, or &#x2018;Z&#x2019; and axis_1 is not equal to axis_2. a and b are 32-bit signed integers.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case output the number of eliminated blocks.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n3 2\nY=1,Z=3\nX=3,Y=1\n10 2\nX=3,Y=3\nY=3,Z=3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5\n19</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2010+Asia+Hangzhou+Regional+Contest+&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2010 Asia Hangzhou Regional Contest  </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
