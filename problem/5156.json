The tree has n nodes. And you can assume the tree rooted at node 1. Harry found that there are some gifts with different colors on some nodes. Then Harry began to count the gifts on the tree. Every time Harrty counted a gift, he written down a pair (a, b) on the paper. Where a indecates which node this gift located, and b indecates the color of this gift. After Harry finished all his counting, for each node x, he wanted to know the number of different kinds of colors that all gifts located on the subtree rooted at node x had.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases,you should process to the end of file.<br>For each test case, there are two integers n m on the first line, n indecates the number of the nodes, m indecates the number of countings. $1 \\leq n \\leq 50000, 1 \\leq m \\leq 500000$<br>The next following n-1 lines.
