He soon became IGM, the  best title of Codefires. Besides, he is famous for his coding speed and the achievement in the field of Data Structures.<br>   After become IGM, Memset137 has a new goal: He wants his score in CF rounds to be as large as possible.<br>   What is score? In Codefires, every problem has 2 attributes, let&apos;s call them Ki and Bi(Ki, Bi&#xFF1E;0). if Memset137 solves the  problem at Ti-th second, he gained Bi-Ki*Ti score. It&apos;s guaranteed Bi-Ki*Ti is always positive during the round time.<br>   Now that Memset137 can solve every problem, in this problem, Bi is of no concern. Please write a program to calculate the  minimal score he will lose.(that is, the sum of Ki*Ti).<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The first line contains an integer N(1&#x2264;N&#x2264;10^5), the number of problem in the round.<br>   The second line contains N integers Ei(1&#x2264;Ei&#x2264;10^4), the time(second) to solve the i-th problem.<br>   The last line contains N integers Ki(1&#x2264;Ki&#x2264;10^4), as was described.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"   One integer L, the minimal score he will lose.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n10 10 20\n1 2 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">150\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>Memset137 takes the first 10 seconds to solve problem B, then solves problem C at the end of the 30th second.
