It is not only fundamental in graph analysis but also crucial in graph search optimization algorithms. Computing k-edge connected components has many real applications. For example, in social networks, computing k-edge connected components can identify the closely related entities to provide useful information for social behavior mining. In a web-link based graph, a highly connected graph may be a group of web pages with a high commonality, which is useful for identifying the similarities among web pages. In computational biology, a highly connected subgraph is likely to be a functional cluster of genes for biologist to conduct the study of gene microarrays. Computing k-edge connected components also potentially contributes to many other technology developments such as graph visualization, robust detection of communication networks, community detection in a social network.<br><br>Clearly, if a graph G is not k-edge connected, there must be a set C of edges, namely a cut, such that the number |C| of edges in C is smaller than k and the removal of the edges in C cuts the graph G into two disconnected subgraphs G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub>. A connected component is a maximal connected subgraph of G. Note that each vertex belongs to exactly one connected component, as does each edge.<br><br>Now, we give you a undirected graph G with n vertices and m edges without self-loop or multiple edge, your task is just find out the number of k-edge connected components in G.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Multicases. 3 integer numbers n, m and k are described in the first line of the testcase.(3&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;n&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;100, 1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;m&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;n&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;(n-1)/2,2&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;k&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;n)The following m lines each line has 2 numbers u, v describe the edges of graph G.(1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;u,v&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;n,u&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;v)","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"A single line containing the answer to the problem.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5 6 3\n1 3\n2 3\n1 4\n2 4\n1 5\n2 5\n9 11 2\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3\n4 5\n4 6\n5 6\n7 8\n7 9\n8 9\n1 4\n1 7\n16 30 3\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 3\n2 4\n3 4\n5 6\n5 7\n5 8\n6 7\n6 8\n7 8\n9 10\n9 11\n9 12\n10 11\n10 12\n11 12\n13 14\n13 15\n13 16\n14 15\n14 16\n15 16\n1 5\n2 6\n1 9\n2 10\n1 13\n2 14</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5\n3\n4\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\n<center><img src=\"../../data/images/C459-1012-1.jpg\"></center>\n<center><img src=\"../../data/images/C459-1012-2.jpg\"></center>\n<center><img src=\"../../data/images/C459-1012-3.jpg\"></center>\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2013+Multi-University+Training+Contest+5&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2013 Multi-University Training Contest 5 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
