The crosses are labeled from 0 to N&#x2013;1. <br>The tricky thief starts his escaping from cross S. Each moment he moves to an adjacent cross. More exactly, assume he is at cross u at the moment t. He may appear at cross v at moment t + 1 if and only if there is a street between cross u and cross v. Notice that he may not stay at the same cross in two consecutive moment.<br>The cops want to know if there&#x2019;s some moment at which it&#x2019;s possible for the thief to appear at any cross in the city.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains multiple test cases:<br>In the first line of the input there&#x2019;s an integer T which is the number of test cases.

M is the number of streets and S is the index of the cross where the thief starts his escaping.<br>For the next M lines, there will be 2 integers u and v in each line (0 &#x2264; u, v &lt; N).
