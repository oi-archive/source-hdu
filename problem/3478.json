The crosses are labeled from 0 to N&#xFFFD;C1. <br>The tricky thief starts his escaping from cross S. Each moment he moves to an adjacent cross. More exactly, assume he is at cross u at the moment t. He may appear at cross v at moment t + 1 if and only if there is a street between cross u and cross v. Notice that he may not stay at the same cross in two consecutive moment.<br>The cops want to know if there&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s some moment at which it&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s possible for the thief to appear at any cross in the city.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains multiple test cases:<br>In the first line of the input there&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s an integer T which is the number of test cases. Then the description of T test cases will be given. <br>For any test case, the first line contains three integers N (&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 100 000), M (&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 500 000), and S. N is the number of crosses. M is the number of streets and S is the index of the cross where the thief starts his escaping.<br>For the next M lines, there will be 2 integers u and v in each line (0 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; u, v &lt; N).
