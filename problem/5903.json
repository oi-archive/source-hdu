For example, &quot;abab&quot;, &quot;aa&quot; are square strings, while &quot;aaa&quot;, &quot;abba&quot; are not.<br><br>Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different.<br><br>Peter has a string $s=s_{1}s_{2}...s_{n}$ of even length. He wants to find a lexicographically smallest square string $t=t_{1}t_{2}...t_{n}$ that the hamming distance between $s$ and $t$ is exact $m$.
