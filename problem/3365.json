Recently the school wants a new ground similar to the former one.<br>The ground is a simple polygon. Suppose it has n edges and the old one is A0,A1,&#x2026;,An-1, the new one is B0,B1,&#x2026;,Bn-1.<br>They must be one-to-one mapping.<br>The new ground can be only worked out by rotating, expanding, contracting and shifting, but not flipping.<br>Now you know all the points of the old ground, B0, and B1. Can you calculate the other points of the new ground?<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains one integer T representing the number of test cases.<br>For each case, first line contains one integer n (3&lt;=n&lt;=10000).<br>Then n lines follow. The i-th line has two integers representing the coordinate of the point Ai. (For each 0&lt;=i&lt;j&lt;n, Ai doesn&apos;t equals Aj)<br>Following one line contains four integers. The first two integers represent the coordinate of the point B0, and the second two integers represent the coordinate of the point B1.
