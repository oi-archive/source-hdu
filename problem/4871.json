For every node i in the graph G, we choose a shortest path from root to i. If there are many shortest paths from root to i, we choose the one that the sequence of passing nodes&apos; number is lexicographically minimum. All edges on the paths that we chose form a shortest-path tree.<br>   Now we want to know how long are the longest simple paths which contain K nodes in the shortest-path tree and how many these paths? Two simple paths are different if the sets of nodes they go through are different.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The first line has a number T (T &lt;= 10), indicating the number of test cases.<br>   For each test case, the first line contains three integers n, m, k(1&lt;=n&lt;=30000,1&lt;=m&lt;=60000,2&lt;=k&lt;=n), denote the number of nodes, the number of edges and the nodes of required paths.<br>   Then next m lines, each lines contains three integers a, b, c(1&lt;=a, b&lt;=n, 1&lt;=c&lt;=10000),denote there is an edge between a, b and length is c.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"   For each case, output two numbers, denote the length of required paths and the numbers of required paths.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n6 6 4\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3 4 1\n2 5 1\n3 6 1\n5 6 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3 4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"FZU","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2014+Multi-University+Training+Contest+1&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2014 Multi-University Training Contest 1 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
