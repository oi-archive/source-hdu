For example, the sequence:<br><b>2 5 1 3 3 7</b><br>may be grouped as:<br><b>(2 5) (1 3 3) (7)</b><br>to yield an equal sum of <b>7</b>.<br><br>Note: The partition that puts all the numbers in a single group is an equal sum partition with the sum equal to the sum of all the numbers in the sequence.<br><br>For this problem, you will write a program that takes as input a sequence of positive integers and returns the smallest sum for an equal sum partition of the sequence.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a single integer <b>P</b>, (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; <b>P</b> &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 1000), which is the number of data sets that follow. The first line of each data set contains the data set number, followed by a space, followed by a decimal integer <b>M</b>, (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; <b>M</b> &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 10000), giving the total number of integers in the sequence. The remaining line(s) in the dataset consist of the values, 10 per line, separated by a single space.
