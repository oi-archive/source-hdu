But some strings are too long that WNJXYK cannot judge whether they are similar to others, so he turns to you for help.<br>Now WNJXYK need you to determine the maximum s, for string A has a substring A&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; and string B has a substring B&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; whose length are both s and they differ on at most K positions.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input starts with one line contains exactly one positive integer T which is the number of test cases.<br>Each test case contains three lines.
