They stand in a line according to their numbers, which means the soldier numbered i stands at the ith position. But the officer of this troop is unsatisfied with the arrangement, he decides to rearrange it. After a careful consideration, the officer develops such rearrangement as follows: He thinks up a permutation of 1 to n, and then commands the aith soldier to stand in the ith position in the new arrangement. However, the new sequence still cannot meet the officer&#x2019;s need. So they have to apply the arrangement repeatedly according to the method the officer thinks up.<br><br><br>For example, there are 5 soldiers in the troop; the permutation in the officer&#x2019;s mind is 2 1 4 5 3. After the first rearrangement, the troop sequence is 2 1 4 5 3. After the second rearrangement, the sequence becomes 1 2 5 3 4.<br><br><br>Unluckily, after a long time of rearrangements, the officer and the soldiers are very tired but the strict officer is still unsatisfied. The poor officer asks the soldiers, &#x201C;Who can tell me the least times of rearrangements needed to reach the arrangement I like.&#x201D; As the smartest soldier you decide to answer the officer&#x2019;s question.<br>Here is an example: if there are 5 soldiers in the troop, the permutation in the officer&#x2019;s mind is 2 1 4 5 3. He wants the troop to be 2 1 3 4 5. The rearrangements are as follows:<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/con210-1001-1.JPG\"></center> <br><br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several cases.
