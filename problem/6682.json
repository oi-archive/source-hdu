As the last episode of Golden Wind has been aired, Rikka, with the help of Yuta, sets up this problem to express the love to Mista.<br><br>Mista&apos;s lucky number is $4$. Today, Mista wants to test his luck with $n$ magic cards: For each card, there is a non-negative integer on each side. The two numbers on the $i$th card are $w_i$ and $0$.<br><br>Firstly, Mista puts these $n$ cards to table one by one. For each card, the probability of the $w_i$ side to be upward is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and these probabilities are independent with each other. As a result, there are $n$ integers on the table. Mista then sums up all these integers and counts the number of $4$s in the decimal representation of this sum: He uses this result to measure his luckiness.<br><br>Since it&apos;s possible for each side of each card to be upward, there are $2^n$ possible states in total. You are required to calculate the sum of the results for all these situations.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains a single integer $T(4 \\leq T \\leq 4)$, the number of test cases.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains a single integer $n(4 \\leq n \\leq 40)$, the number of the cards.<br><br>The second line contains $n$ integers $w_1, \\dots, w_n(4 \\leq w_i \\leq 44444444)$, the positive numbers on the cards.
