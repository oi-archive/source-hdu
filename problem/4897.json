The devil always asks the king to do some crazy things. Although the king used to be wise and beloved by his people. Now he is just like a boy in love and can&#x2019;t refuse any request from the devil. Also, this devil is looking like a very cute Loli.<br><br>   The devil likes to make thing in chaos. This kingdom&#x2019;s road system is like simply a tree(connected graph without cycle). A road has a color of black or white. The devil often wants to make some change of this system.<br><br>   In details, we call a path on the tree from a to b consists of vertices lie on the shortest simple path between a and b. And we say an edge is on the path if both its two endpoints is in the path, and an edge is adjacent to the path if exactly one endpoint of it is in the path.<br><br>   Sometimes the devil will ask you to reverse every edge&#x2019;s color on a path or adjacent to a path.<br><br>   The king&#x2019;s daughter, WJMZBMR, is also a cute loli, she is surprised by her father&#x2019;s lolicon-like behavior. As she is concerned about the road-system&#x2019;s status, sometimes she will ask you to tell there is how many black edge on a path.<br>   <br>   Initially, every edges is white.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"   The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of the test cases.<br>   For each test case, the first line contains an integer n, which is the size of the tree.
