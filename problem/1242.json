He was put in prison by Moligpy. The prison is described as a N * M (N, M &lt;= 200) matrix. There are WALLs, ROADs, and GUARDs in the prison.<br><br>Angel&apos;s friends want to save Angel. Their task is: approach Angel. We assume that &quot;approach Angel&quot; is to get to the position where Angel stays. When there&apos;s a guard in the grid, we must kill him (or her?) to move into the grid. We assume that we moving up, down, right, left takes us 1 unit time, and killing a guard takes 1 unit time, too. And we are strong enough to kill all the guards.<br><br>You have to calculate the minimal time to approach Angel.
