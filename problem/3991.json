After planning the route for a while, Harry realizes he can&#x2019;t do it by himself, he need to find some friends to help him. But the new question is, how many friends Harry should ask at least? We can assume every magician can choose the original city and time to begin his/her journey, and all of them have the same speed, one unit distance per unit time. And if he/she is exactly in city Pi at time Ti, he/she will give the present in a wink, yes, as you see, they are magicians.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C360-1010-1.jpg\"></center> ","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer T, indicating the number of test cases.<br>Each test case begins with three integers N, M, Q.
