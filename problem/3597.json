We can consider that the length every part of rail is 1.In light of our report,there are M(M&lt;=100000) carriers are uncontrollable.The number i uncontrollable carrier is at the middle of the number p[i](0&lt;=p[i]&lt;=N-1) rail.To destroy the carriers,we have M remote control bombs.The number I bombs is at the middle of the number q[i](0&lt;=q[i]&lt;=N-1) rail.We can let a bomb move to a carrier.When it move from number i rail to number i+1(or number i-1) rail it cost 1 energy(<font color=\"red\">bombs in number N-1 rail can move to number 0 rail </font>,it also cost 1 energy;Remember bombs cannot leave the rail ) .The more energy we used when we move,The less damage we can make to the carriers.Clearly, We must spend the minimal energy to move all the bombs on to the carrier.One bombs can just destroy one carrier,even two carrier are at the same place.<br>We can imagine that carrier do not move.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test case.<br>For each test case: The first line contain 2 integers.N,M.
