But now when he looks at these photos, he finds in surprise that he isn&apos;t able to point out even the number of buildings in it. So he decides to work it out as follows:<br>- divide the photo into n vertical pieces from left to right. The buildings in the photo can be treated as rectangles, the lower edge of which is the horizon. One building may span several consecutive pieces, but each piece can only contain one visible building, or no buildings at all.<br>- measure the height of each building in that piece.<br>- write a program to calculate the minimum number of buildings.<br>Mr. B has finished the first two steps, the last comes to you.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Each test case starts with a line containing an integer n (1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100,000).
