Unfortunately, the Cube fell to the ground and broke. It took you some time to explore the construction of the Cube. Then you assembled the Pocket Cube. Unfortunately, you didn&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t assembled it in the right way. So here is the question. You want to know whether it can return to the right position.<br><br>   The right position means four blocks in each face has the same color. You can only rotate the Cube to return it to the right position.<br><br>   A Cube is given in its layout.<br> <center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/5292-2.jpg\"></center><br> <center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/5292-3.jpg\"></center><br>   The right position rotates in red face clockwisely. <br>   You can get more details from input case.<br>w represents white , y represents yellow , o represents orange , r represents red , g represents green , b represents blue.
