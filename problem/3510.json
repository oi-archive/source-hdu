They have to schedule n jobs on m machines. Each job needs exactly one unit time on one machine. At first, YouAreSoStrong   thought ceil(n/m) units of time is enough. Soon, they find out there exist some ordering constraints between jobs. This is reasonable. For example, you have to complete &quot;hand in hand&quot; before you can &quot;hug&quot;. And only after you&apos;ve done &quot;hug&quot;, can you &quot;kiss&quot;. It&apos;s guaranteed that following 3 conditions are satisfied.<br>1. one job can only be relied by at most one job. <br>2. one job may rely more than one job.  <br>3.There is no circular dependency. Such as a relies on b, and b relies on a. <br>YouAreSoStrong thought for a long time, but do not have a clue. Can you help them?<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"First line contains one integer T, indicates the number of test cases.
