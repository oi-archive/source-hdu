Yuta is worrying about this situation, so he gives Rikka some math tasks to practice. There is one of them:<br><br>Yuta has a non-direct graph with n vertices and n+1 edges. Rikka can choose some of the edges (at least one) and delete them from the graph.<br><br>Yuta wants to know the number of the ways to choose the edges in order to make the remaining graph connected.<br><br>It is too difficult for Rikka. Can you help her?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a number $T(T \\leq 30)$&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;The number of the testcases.<br><br>For each testcase, the first line contains a number $n(n \\leq 100)$.<br><br>Then n+1 lines follow.
