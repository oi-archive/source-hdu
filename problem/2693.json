A smart guy in that world invented a camera, whose viewfinder was a  <br>triangle. The camera&apos;s visual range could be represented by three RAYS. As the figure shows, the camera&apos;s visual  <br>range could be represented by three rays OA, OB, OC. Note that the visual range is INFINITE. <br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/2693.jpg\">  <br><br>Now, we have a camera with known visual range and a triangle DEF in the space. The inventor wants to know if the  <br>camera can see the triangle, in other words, if there is at least one point of the triangle strict in the visual range.

The first line of input contains an integer T, which is the number of test cases. <br><br>The first line of each test case contains 12 integers: Ox, Oy, Oz, Ax, Ay, Az, Bx, By, Bz, Cx, Cy, Cz. The second line  <br>contains 9 integers: Dx, Dy, Dz, Ex, Ey, Ez, Fx, Fy, Fz. <br>All the integers in a line are separated by a whitespace. <br><br>[Technical Specification] <br>T is an integer, and T &lt;= 1000. <br>The input guaranteed that if you look from O, three points ABC are always arranged counterclockwise. <br>All integers EXCEPT T is in the range of [-100,100]. <br>We guarantee the camera and the triangle are not degenerate.
