Each switch is associated to a distinct integer in 0...2<sup>N</sup>-1 with exactly three ones in its binary representation. By setting switches associated with number X<sub>0</sub>,X<sub>1</sub>...X<sub>M-1</sub> to on, any integer Y passing through the machine will render a result of  Y&#x2295;X<sub>0</sub>&#x2295;X<sub>1</sub>&#x2295;...&#x2295;X<sub>M-1</sub>(here &#x201C;&#x2295;&#x201D; stands for bitwise-XOR).<br>We are interested in the number of configurations capable of transforming integer S into T with exactly K switches set to on. Could you write a program to help us?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases in the input file.<br>Each test case starts with two integers, N and K (1 &#x2264; N &#x2264; 40 , 0 &#x2264; K &#x2264; min{20 , C(N,3)} ), followed by two binary integers, S and T, each containing exactly N bits.<br>Two successive test cases are separated by a blank line. A case with N = 0 and K = 0 indicates the end of the input file, and should not be processed by your program.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, please print a single integer, the total number of ways to<br>transform the first integer into the second one.
