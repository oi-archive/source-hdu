The Wonderland can be seen as a grid with $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Tom numbers the rows with integers from $1$ to $n$ from top to bottom and the columns with integers from $1$ to $m$ from left to right. He starts from the upper-left cell $(1, 1)$.<br>Tom can move down if and only if he is in the middle column of the grid (the $\\frac{m+1}{2}$th column). Otherwise, he can only go left or right. Each movement takes him $1$ second.<br>There are $k$ bottles of milk on the grid. The $i$th bottle is located in the $r_i$th row and $c_i$th column, and Tom needs $t_i$ seconds to finish it.<br>In order to enjoy the milk alone, he wants to do it as fast as possible. So he wants to know the minimum time he needs to finish $i(i=1,2,\\cdots,k)$ bottles of milk.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains one integer $T(1\\le T\\le 2500)$, the number of test cases.<br>For each test case, the first line contains $3$ integers $n,m,k(3\\le n,m\\le 10^9,1\\le k\\le 10^4,\\sum k\\le 6\\times 10^4)$, where $m$ is guaranteed to be an odd number.<br>Each of the next $k$ lines contains $3$ integers $r_i,c_i,t_i(1\\le r_i\\le n,1\\le c_i\\le m,c_i\\ne\\frac{m+1}{2},1\\le t_i\\le 10^9)$, the position of $i$th bottle of milk and the time it takes Tom to drink.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one line containing $k$ integers separated by space, the $i$th of which indicates the minimum time Tom needs to finish exactly $i$ bottles of milk.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n7 7 2\n3 7 1\n4 5 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">8 15</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2019+Multi-University+Training+Contest+1&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2019 Multi-University Training Contest 1 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
