For example, if A is 2 and B is 3, then N = A<sup>B</sup> = 8, a<sub>0</sub> = 1, a<sub>1</sub> = 2, a<sub>2</sub> = 4, a<sub>3</sub> = 8, so the value of M is 1 + 8 + 27 + 64 = 100.<br>However, contrary to what Xiaoming believes, this encryption scheme is extremely vulnerable. Can you write a program to prove it?<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases in the input file.
