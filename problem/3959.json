Maybe with eight or twelve sides.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/data/images/C361_1009_1.jpg\"></center><br>hh plays with N friends today(including himself). They&apos;ll choose one person to be the judge. But the problem is: there is only a M-sided dice. How to pick a judge with the dice, so that everyone has equal probability of being chosen (the probability should always be 1/N)?<br>hh has an idea here:<br>1)Get x<br>Decide rolling the dice x times. x is the smallest integer to make M<sup>x</sup> larger than or equal to N.<br><br>2)Players choose sequences<br>Each player chooses a sequence with x elements (1~M).<br>For example, a 6-sides dice and x equal to 3, hh will gets sequence [5 4 6]. Players&apos; sequences should be different from each other.(such as [6 4 5] is different from [5 4 6])<br><br>3)Pick the judge<br>Roll the dice for x times, we can get a result sequence, if someone has the same sequence as the result, he will be the judge; otherwise, repeat 1)-3), until the judge is chosen.<br><br>It&apos;s a bigger project, hh wants know the expected number of times we will need to throw dice to determine the judge.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is a number T(1&lt;=T&lt;=100), which represents the number of cases.
