There is a magical country on the planet. There are N cities in the country. The country is magical because there are exactly N-1 magic roads between the N cities, and from each city, it is possible to visit any other city. But after the huge expansion of the country, the road system seems to be messy. The moderator decided to rebuild the road system.<br><br>As a worker, I cannot do too much things. I could just move one road to another position connecting arbitrary 2 cities using my magic, keeping its length unchanged. Of course, afterwards all the N cities have to be still connected. I wonder how to move in order to make the farthest distance between any two cities minimum. Could you solve it for me?<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input is one integer T (T &#x2264; 10), and then T test cases follow.<br>Each test case begins with a line contains only one integer N (N &#x2264; 2500), means there are N magic cities.
