In the game there are two players trying to kill each other to win the game.<br><br>The game provides $n$ weapons, each has two properties: Damage and Delay. The $i^\\mathrm{th}$ weapon has Damage $A_i$ and Delay $D_i$. When a player shoots with this weapon, his enemy&apos;s HP is reduced by $A_i$, then he must wait for $D_i$ ms before he can shoot again.<br><br>The game processes as follows:<br><br>1. Before the game starts, Zhang3 and Father choose a weapon respectively. Father always randomly chooses one of the $n$ weapons with equal probabilities. Each player can only use the chosen weapon during the game.<br>2. When the game starts, Zhang3 and Father have $100$ HP each. They make their first shot at the same time.<br>3. They keep shooting as quickly as possible. That means, a player shoots instantly whenever he can shoot, until the game ends.<br>4. When a player&apos;s HP is reduced to 0 or lower, he dies and the game ends. If the other player is still alive (i.e. has HP higher than 0), then the living player wins the game; otherwise (if the two players die at the same time), each player has $50\\%$ probability to win the game.<br><br>Zhang3 wants to win the game. Please help her to choose a weapon so that the probability to win is maximized. Print the optimal probability.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input gives the number of test cases,  $T \\; (1 \\le T \\le 100)$. $T$ test cases follow.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains an integer $n \\; (1 \\le n \\le 1000)$, the number of weapons in the game.<br><br>Then $n$ lines follow, the $i^\\mathrm{th}$ of which contains two integers $A_i, D_i \\; (1 \\le A_i \\le 100, \\; 1 \\le D_i \\le 10000)$, representing the Damage and the Delay of each weapon.<br><br>The sum of $n$ in all test cases doesn&apos;t exceed $2000$.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print a line with a real number $p \\; (0 \\le p \\le 1)$, representing the optimal probability.<br><br>Your answers should have absolute or relative errors of at most $10^{-6}$.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n1\n100 100\n4\n50 50\n40 20\n30 10\n20 100</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">0.5\n0.875</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2020+Multi-University+Training+Contest+4&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2020 Multi-University Training Contest 4 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
