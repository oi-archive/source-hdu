During this summer holiday, he, along with Zhang and Liu, is going to travel to Hong Kong. There are $n$ spots in Hong Kong, and $n - 1$ bidirectional sightseeing bus routes connecting these spots. They decide to visit some spots by bus.<br><br>However, Zhang and Liu have different preferences for these spots. They respectively set a satisfactory value for each spot. If they visit the $i$th spot, Zhang will obtain satisfactory value $a_i$, and Liu will obtain $b_i$. Starting with Zhang, they alternately decide the next spot to visit for the sake of fairness. There must be a bus route between the current spot and the next spot to visit. Moreover, they would never like to visit a spot twice. If anyone can&apos;t find such a next spot to visit, they have no choice but to end this travel.<br><br>Zhang and Liu are both super smart competitive programmers. Either want to maximize the difference between his total satisfactory value and the other&apos;s. Now Acesrc wonders, if they both choose optimally, what is the difference between total satisfactory values of Zhang and Liu?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input consists of a single integer $T$ $(1 \\leq T \\leq 30)$, denoting the number of test cases.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5)$, denoting the number of spots.
