He use identical bottles to carry the medicine. There are different types of medicine.

When Huatuo arrived the patient&apos;s home, he took the chain out of his bag, and he could not recognize which bottle contains which type of medicine, but he remembers the order of the bottles on the chain.<br><br>Huatuo has his own solution to resolve this problem. When he need to bring 2 types of medicines, E.g. $A$ and $B$, he will put $A$ into one bottle and put $B$ into two bottles. Then he will chain the bottles in the order of $&apos;-B-A-B-&apos;$. In this way, when he arrived the patient&apos;s home, he knew that the bottle in the middle is medicine $A$ and the bottle on two sides are medicine $B$.<br><br>Now you need to help Huatuo to work out what&apos;s the minimal number of bottles needed if he want to bring $N$ types of medicine.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T(1&#x2264;T&#x2264;100)$. $T$ lines follow.
