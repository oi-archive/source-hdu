The first group stands in a line, but the other group has a magic gun that can shoot a range [a, b], and everyone in that range will take a damage of c points. When a gangster is taking damage, if he has already taken at least P point of damage, then the damage will be doubled. You are required to calculate the damage that each gangster in the first group toke.<br>To simplify the problem, you are given an array A of length N and a magic number P. Initially, all the elements in this array are 0.<br>Now, you have to perform a sequence of operation. Each operation is represented as (a, b, c), which means: For each A[i] (a &lt;= i &lt;= b), if A[i] &lt; P, then A[i] will be A[i] + c, else A[i] will be A[i] + c * 2.<br>Compute all the elements in this array when all the operations finish.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists several testcases.<br>The first line contains three integers n, m, P (1 &lt;= n, m, P &lt;= 200000), denoting the size of the array, the number of operations and the magic number.<br>Next m lines represent the operations.
