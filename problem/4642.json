At the beginning, there are N*M coins in this board with one in each grid and every coin may be upward or downward freely. Then they take turns to choose a rectangle (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)-(n, m) (1 &#x2264; x<sub>1</sub>&#x2264;n, 1&#x2264;y<sub>1</sub>&#x2264;m) and flips all the coins (upward to downward, downward to upward) in it (i.e. flip all positions (x, y) where x<sub>1</sub>&#x2264;x&#x2264;n, y<sub>1</sub>&#x2264;y&#x2264;m)). The only restriction is that the top-left corner (i.e. (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)) must be changing from upward to downward. The game ends when all coins are downward, and the one who cannot play in his (her) turns loses the game. Here&apos;s the problem: Who will win the game if both use the best strategy? You can assume that Alice always goes first.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the date is an integer T, which is the number of the text cases.<br>Then T cases follow, each case starts with two integers N and M indicate the size of the board.
