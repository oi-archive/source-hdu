He often goes to the website Wikipedia to study computer science. Just now Charles seriously studied a series of expressions, in which algebraic expression has a great influence on him.<br><br>He is curious about how many different algebraic expressions built up from $n$ distinct variables, elementary arithmetic operations (i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division), and brackets such that each variable appears exactly once and each operation is after a variable or a pair of brackets. Can you help him calculate the answer in modulo $(10^9 + 7)$?<br><br>Two algebraic expressions in this problem are considered as equivalent if and only if they can be simplified as the same rational expression. For example, assuming $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are variables, $(a - d) / (b - c)$ is equivalent to $(d - a) / (c - b)$, $a / (b - c) * d$ is equivalent to $a / ((b - c) / d)$ but $a / b + c / d$ is not equivalent to $d / c + b / a$.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains one integer $T$, indicating the number of test cases.<br>Each of the following $T$ lines describes a test case and contains only one integer $n$.<br>$1 \\leq T, n \\leq 60000$.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output the answer modulo $(10^9 + 7)$ in one line.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">6\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n6\n68\n1170\n27142\n793002</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2018+Multi-University+Training+Contest+5&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2018 Multi-University Training Contest 5 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
