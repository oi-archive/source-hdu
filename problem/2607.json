How excited it is to see balloons floating around.<br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C154-1008-1.jpg\"><br>I knew you had solved the HDOJ 1004 Let the Balloon Rise already, so please settle the another version quickly. I have a lot of balloons and each has a color and I give each of them a number, same color has the same number. For example, red balloon is No.1, pink is No.2, black is No.3 . etc. I also have many rooms to store all the balloons.<br>There are some rules :<br>1. Every room stores several balloons but no two have the same color.<br>2. Collect all the balloons, we can find each color has even number of times of balloons except one.<br><br>Your task is to find which is the odd color and calculate its number of times.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Input file consists from multiple data sets separated by one or more empty lines.<br>Each data set represents a sequence of 32-bit (positive) integers (references) which are stored in compressed way.<br>Each line of input set consists from three single space separated 32-bit (positive) integers X Y Z and they represent following sequence of No.X, X+Z, X+2*Z, X+3*Z, &#x2026;, X+K*Z, &#x2026;(while (X+K*Z)&lt;=Y).
