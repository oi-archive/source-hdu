One day, Kayaking finds a bucket. The bottom area of the bucket is S and the height is H. Initially, there is V volume water in the bucket. What makes Kayaking happy is that there are N cube woods beside the bucket. The side length of the i-th cube woods is L[i] and its density is P[i]. Kayaking wants to put all the cube woods to the bucket. And then he will put a cover at the top of the bucket. But CoffeeDog doesn&#x2019;t allow unless Kayaking can tell CoffeeDog the height of the water in the bucket after Kayaking put all the cuboid woods to the bucket.
