Several cherries are scattered on the top of the cake with at most one cherry on a unit square. The slicing should follow the rules below:<br>1.&#xA0;&#xA0;each piece is rectangular or square;<br>2.&#xA0;&#xA0;each cutting edge is straight and along a grid line;<br>3.&#xA0;&#xA0;each piece has only one cherry on it;<br>4.&#xA0;&#xA0;each cut must split the cake you currently cut two separate parts<br><br>For example, assume that the cake has a grid of 3*4 unit squares on its top, and there are three cherries on the top, as shown in the figure below.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C150-1009-1.jpg\"></center><br>One allowable slicing is as follows.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C150-1009-2.jpg\"></center><br>For this way of slicing , the total length of the cutting edges is 2+4=6.<br> Another way of slicing is <br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C150-1009-3.jpg\"></center><br>In this case, the total length of the cutting edges is 3+2=5.<br><br> Give the shape of the cake and the scatter of the  cherries , you are supposed to find<br>out  the least total length of the cutting edges.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file contains multiple test cases.
