Your job is to make the maximum sum using the least number of consecutive sub-sequences. For example, given (6,-1&#xFF0C;0, -2, 3), the max sum in this sequence is 9, the number of sub-sequences is 2 not 3, they are(6), (3).","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer T(1&lt;=T&lt;=20) which means the number of test cases.
