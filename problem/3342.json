It is so harmonious that just like a big family. Every day,many &quot;holy cows&quot; like HH, hh, AC, ZT, lcc, BF, Qinz and so on chat on-line to exchange their ideas. When someone has questions, many warm-hearted cows like Lost will come to help. Then the one being helped will call Lost &quot;master&quot;, and Lost will have a nice &quot;prentice&quot;. By and by, there are many pairs of &quot;master and prentice&quot;. But then problem occurs: there are too many masters and too many prentices, how can we know whether it is legal or not?<br><br>We all know a master can have many prentices and a prentice may have a lot of masters too, it&apos;s legal. Nevertheless&#xFF0C;some cows are not so honest, they hold illegal relationship. Take HH and 3xian for instant, HH is 3xian&apos;s master and, at the same time, 3xian is HH&apos;s master,which is quite illegal! To avoid this,please help us to judge whether their relationship is legal or not. <br><br>Please note that the &quot;master and prentice&quot; relation is transitive. It means that if A is B&apos;s master ans B is C&apos;s master, then A is C&apos;s master.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases. For each case, the first line contains two integers, N (members to be tested) and M (relationships to be tested)(2 &lt;= N, M &lt;= 100). Then M lines follow, each contains a pair of (x, y) which means x is y&apos;s master and y is x&apos;s prentice. The input is terminated by N = 0.<br>TO MAKE IT SIMPLE, we give every one a number (0, 1, 2,..., N-1).
