And in this year all the retired TJU-ACMers want to get together to celebrate the tenth anniversary. Because the retired TJU-ACMers may live in different places around the world, it may be hard to find out where to celebrate this meeting in order to minimize the sum travel time of all the retired TJU-ACMers. <br>There is an infinite integer grid at which N retired TJU-ACMers have their houses on. They decide to unite at a common meeting place, which is someone&apos;s house. From any given cell, only 4 adjacent cells are reachable in 1 unit of time.<br>Eg: (x,y) can be reached from (x-1,y), (x+1,y), (x, y-1), (x, y+1).<br>Finding a common meeting place which minimizes the sum of the travel time of all the retired TJU-ACMers.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is an integer T represents there are T test cases.
