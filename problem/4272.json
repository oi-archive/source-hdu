Today I invent a new game called LianLianKan. The game is about playing on a number stack.<br>Now we have a number stack, and we should link and pop the same element pairs from top to bottom. Each time, you can just link the top element with one same-value element. After pop them from stack, all left elements will fall down. Although the game seems to be interesting, it&apos;s really naive indeed. <br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C413-1006-1.jpg\"></center> <br>To prove I am a wisdom among my friend, I add an additional rule to the game: for each top element, it can just link with the same-value element whose distance is less than 6 with it. <br>Before the game, I want to check whether I have a solution to pop all elements in the stack.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.<br>The first line is an integer N indicating the number of elements in the stack initially.
