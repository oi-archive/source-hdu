The positive integer n(0&lt;n&lt;101) is given in the first line. The next 2n lines are the matrix which describe the two graphs G and H. The j elements in the i rows is either 0 or 1. If the node i and the node j has a edge in the graph. The elements will be 1. Otherwise is 0. It&#x2019;s guaranteed that the matrix is symmetry and the i elements in the i row is always 0. See sample input for more details.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"&#x3000;&#x3000;For each case, first output an integer L in a line, which should represent the length of the switch sequence you found.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;If no switch sequence can transform G into H, then you should print L as -1 and no more lines. Otherwise output L lines follow. Each of the L lines should contains four distinct integers x, y, z and w, indicating a 2-switch on G, as described.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br>&#x3000;&#x3000;For some reason, if L is equal to or larger than 1000000, ivankevin would think the switch sequence you found is so ugly that it is ungelieveble and unacceptable. Otherwise, if L &lt; 1000000 and the sequence finally transform G into H, he will accept your answer.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n4\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n0 1 3 2\n-1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"SYSU","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2013+Multi-University+Training+Contest+2&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2013 Multi-University Training Contest 2 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
