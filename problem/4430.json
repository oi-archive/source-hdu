Ran and Chen hold a celebration party for her. Now comes the most important part, birthday cake! But it&apos;s a big challenge for them to place n candles on the top of the cake. As Yukari has lived for such a long long time, though she herself insists that she is a 17-year-old girl.<br>        To make the birthday cake look more beautiful, Ran and Chen decide to place them like r &#x2265; 1 concentric circles. They place k<sup>i</sup> candles equidistantly on the i-th circle, where k &#x2265; 2, 1 &#x2264; i &#x2264; r. And it&apos;s optional to place at most one candle at the center of the cake. In case that there are a lot of different pairs of r and k satisfying these restrictions, they want to minimize r &#xD7; k. If there is still a tie, minimize r.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"        There are about 10,000 test cases.
