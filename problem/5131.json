It tells a story about 108 outlaws. They came from different backgrounds (including scholars, fishermen, imperial drill instructors etc.), and all of them eventually came to occupy Mout Liang(or Liangshan Marsh) and elected Song Jiang as their leader.<br><br>   In order to encourage his military officers, Song Jiang always made a rank list after every battle. In the rank list, all 108 outlaws were ranked by the number of enemies he/she killed in the battle. The more enemies one killed, one&apos;s rank is higher. If two outlaws killed the same number of enemies, the one whose name is smaller in alphabet order had higher rank. Now please help Song Jiang to make the rank list and answer some queries based on the rank list.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   There are no more than 20 test cases.<br><br>   For each test case:<br><br>   The first line is an integer N (0&lt;N&lt;200), indicating that there are N outlaws.<br><br>   Then N lines follow.
