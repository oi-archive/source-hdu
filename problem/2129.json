There are a lot of schools attend the contests, and each school has some teams or none, and each team may get some prizes of not. There are three kinds of prizes of the contests: gold, silver and copper, and gold is the best one and silver is better than copper. Now we get the result of all the schools, you should rank them, and print them according to the below rules:<br><br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;1) We define the ranks between any two schools (or two teams) as the follow rules: firstly we compare the number of gold prizes, and the school is better whose number of gold prizes is larger, and if the numbers of gold prize are the same then compare the silver prizes and then copper prizes. If all the numbers of gold prizes and silver prizes and copper prizes are the same, then we just say the two school (or two teams) are the same good, and their ranks are the same, you have to obey the lexicographic orders when you print them, though.<br><br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;2) We define the rank number as the following rule: if there are three schools (or three teams), A is as good as B, but better than C. So the rank number of A and B is 1 (the rank number starts from 1), and C is 3, we omit the rank number 2. If more, the rule goes on.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are T cases come, and the first line contains just one integer T. <br>In each case of following T ones, there is an integer N indicates that there are N following lines describe the information of the encouragement. <br>Each line contains fours strings: the name of the school, the name of the team, the kind of the prize (&quot;none&quot; means the team gets no prize), and the contest hosting place.
