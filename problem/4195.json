A square, for example, is a regular convex polygon. You are given three points which are vertices of a regular convex polygon R; can you determine the minimum number of vertices that R must have?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Each test case consists of three lines. Line i consists of two floating point values x<sub>i</sub> and y<sub>i</sub> (-10<sup>4</sup> &lt;=\u0014x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>&lt;=10<sup>4</sup>) where (x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>) are the coordinates of a vertex of R. The coordinates are given with a precision of 10<sup>-6</sup>, i.e., they di\u000bffer from the exact coordinates by at most 10<sup>-6</sup>. You may assume that for each test case the Euclidean distance between any two given points is at least 1, and R has at most 1000 vertices. The input will finish with a line containing the word END.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print one line with the minimum number of vertices that R must have.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">-1385.736326 -146.954822\n430.000292 -2041.361203\n1162.736034 478.316025\n0.000000 4147.000000\n-4147.000000 0.000000\n0.000000 -4147.000000\nEND</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=SWERC+2011&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> SWERC 2011 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
