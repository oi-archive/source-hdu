Cut the paper horizontally (parallel to the shorter side) to get two rectangular parts. <br>2. From the first part, cut out a circle of maximum radius. The circle will form the bottom of the cylinder. <br>3. Roll the second part up in such a way that it has a perimeter of equal length with the circle&apos;s circumference, and attach one end of the roll to the circle. Note that the roll may have some overlapping parts in order to get the required length of the perimeter. <br>Given the dimensions of the sheet of paper, can you calculate the biggest possible volume of a cylinder which can be constructed using the procedure described above? <br><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases.
