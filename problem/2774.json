You assume that the shuffle algorithm of your music player makes a random permutation of the songs in the playlist and plays the songs in that order until all songs have been played. Then it reshuffles and starts playing the list again.<br><br>You have a history of the songs that have been played. However, your record of the history of played songs is not complete, as you started recording songs at a certain point in time and a number of songs might already have been played. From this history, you want to know at how many different points in the future the next reshuffle might occur.<br><br>A potential future reshuffle position is valid if it divides the recorded history into intervals of length s (the number of songs in the playlist) with the first and last interval possibly containing less than s songs and no interval contains a specific song more than once.
