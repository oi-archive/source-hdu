Firstly, he randomly generates an integer $n \\in [1, N]$ in equal probability. And then he randomly generates a permutation of length $n$ in equal probability. Afterwards, he runs the interesting program(function calculate()) with this permutation as a parameter and then gets a returning value. Please output the expectation of this value modulo $998244353$.<br><br>A permutation of length $n$ is an array of length $n$ consisting of integers only $\\in [1, n]$ which are pairwise different.<br><br>An inversion pair in a permutation $p$ is a pair of indices $(i, j)$ such that $i &gt; j$ and $p_i &lt; p_j$. For example, a permutation $[4, 1, 3, 2]$ contains $4$ inversions: $(2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3)$.<br><br>In mathematics, a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
