The figure in the lower-left is not a polycube because some cubes are attached along an edge.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C178-1007-1.jpg\"></center><br>For this problem, the polycube will be formed from unit cubes centered at integer lattice points in 3-space. The polycube will be built up one cube at a time, starting with a cube centered at (0,0,0). At each step of the process (after the first cube), the next cube must have a face in common with a cube previously included and not be the same as a block previously included. For example, a 1-by-1-by-5 block (as shown above in the upper-left polycube) could be built up as:<br><br>(0,0,0) (0,0,1) (0,0,2) (0,0,3) (0,0,4)<br><br>and a 2-by-2-by-2 cube (upper-right figure) could be built as:<br><br>(0,0,0) (0,0,1) (0,1,1) (0,1, 0) (1,0,0) (1,0,1) (1,1,1) (1,1, 0)<br><br>Since the surface of the polycube is made up of unit squares, its area is an integer.<br><br>Write a program which takes as input a sequence of integer lattice points in 3-space and determines whether is correctly forms a polycube and, if so, what the surface area of the polycube is.
