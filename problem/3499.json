He is so upset that he decides to take a trip to some other city to avoid meeting her. He will travel only by air and he can go to any city if there exists a flight and it can help him reduce the total cost to the destination. There&apos;s a problem here: Shua Shua has a special credit card which can reduce half the price of a ticket ( i.e. 100 becomes 50, 99 becomes 49. The original and reduced price are both integers. ). But he can only use it once. He has no idea which flight he should choose to use the card to make the total cost least. Can you help him?
