Instead, he let everyone choose a positive integer $a_i$ to represent his opinion. When finished, the leader will choose a pair of positive interges $m(m&gt;1)$ and $k(0\\leq k&lt;m)$, and regard those people whose number is exactly $k$ modulo $m$ as &apos;&apos;Yes&apos;&apos;, while others as &apos;&apos;No&apos;&apos;.
