The paper is a convex polygon. Goddess wants to cut off some circles from the paper. These circles may overlap but will not exceed the paper.<br><br>   The paper may rotate around the select vertex, when Jitui selects a vertex from the paper and hang it on the wall. Given the original coordinates, now Jitui wants to know the coordinates of every vertex when the paper is stable.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"   There are several test cases, please process till EOF.<br><br>   The first line contains n, m, p (1 &#x2264; n,m &#x2264; 2000, 1 &#x2264; p &#x2264; n) means number of convex polygon vertex, number of circles and the number of vertex Jitui selects.<br>   Next n lines, each line contains two integers x, y (|x|, |y| &#x2264; 10000) means the coordinates of every vertex of the paper.<br>   Next m lines, each line contains three integers x, y, r describes a circle radius is r and center is (x, y).<br><br>   The convex polygon will be given in counter-clockwise.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"   For each test contains n lines.
