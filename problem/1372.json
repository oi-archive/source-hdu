He thinks that the most difficult part of the problem is determining the smallest number of knight moves between two given squares and that, once you have accomplished this, finding the tour would be easy.<br>Of course you know that it is vice versa. So you offer him to write a program that solves the &quot;difficult&quot; part. <br><br>Your job is to write a program that takes two squares a and b as input and then determines the number of knight moves on a shortest route from a to b. <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file will contain one or more test cases.
