They always take subway to work together. There are $N$ subway stations on their route, numbered from 1 to $N$. Station 1 is their home and station $N$ is the company.<br>One day, Mr. Panda was getting up later. When he came to the station, God Sheep has departed $X$ minutes ago. Mr. Panda was very hurried, so he started to chat with God Sheep to communicate their positions. The content is when Mr. Panda is between station $A$ and $B$, God Sheep is just between station $C$ and $D$.<br>$B$ is equal to $A + 1$ which means Mr. Panda is between station $A$ and $A + 1$ exclusive, or $B$ is equal to $A$ which means Mr. Panda is exactly on station $A$. Vice versa for $C$ and $D$. What&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s more, the communication can only be made no earlier than Mr. Panda departed and no later than God Sheep arrived.<br>After arriving at the company, Mr. Panda want to know how many minutes between each adjacent subway stations. Please note that the stop time at each station was ignored.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ test cases follow.<br>Each test case starts with a line consists of 3 integers $N$, $M$ and $X$, indicating the number of stations, the number of chat contents and the minute interval between Mr. Panda and God Sheep.
