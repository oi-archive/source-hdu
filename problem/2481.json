It is constructed with N+1(N&gt;=3) balls and 2*N sticks. All balls are in a same plane. One of them is special, while the other N balls are connected to it by N sticks with the same length. The angles between any two adjacent sticks are equal. And finally, any two adjacent balls(except the central one) are connected by a stick.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Here are two examples:<br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C165-1008-1.jpg\"><br>Anthony wanted to remove N sticks, leaving all balls still connected. He wanted to know the number of all legal solutions. Your task is to solve this problem for him. <br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Notice that if a solution will be the same as another one by rotation, these two solutions should be consider as the same. <br>The answer may be quite large. You just need to calculate the remainder of the answer when divided by M.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Input contains several test cases. <br>For each test case, there is only one line containing two integers N and M(3&lt;=N&lt;=10^9, 2&lt;=M&lt;=10^9). <br>Input is terminated by EOF.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each case, output one integer in one line, representing the remainder of the number of all solutions when divided by M.<br><br>","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3 10000\n4 10000\n4 10</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">6\n13\n3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2008+Asia+Regional+Chengdu&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2008 Asia Regional Chengdu </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
