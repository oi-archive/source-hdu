At the beginning, each player receives N cards. The pip of a card is a positive integer which is at most N*M. And there are no two cards with the same pip. During a round, each player chooses one card to compare with others. The player whose card with the biggest pip wins the round, and then the next round begins. After N rounds, when all the cards of each player have been chosen, the player who has won the most rounds is the winner of the game. <br>Given your cards received at the beginning, write a program to tell the maximal number of rounds that you may at least win during the whole game.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains two integers m (2 &lt;= m &lt;= 20) and n (1 &lt;= n &lt;= 50), representing the number of players and the number of cards each player receives at the beginning of the game, respectively. This followed by a line with n positive integers, representing the pips of cards you received at the beginning.
