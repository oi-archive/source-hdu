Recently, Jiaoshou had cleared &#x201C;Need for Speed Undercover&#x201D;. In this game, Jiaoshou acted as a spy. To prove that he is not a spy, Jiaoshou must do some evil things frequently. So lots of police cars often ran after him. In order to escape from the chase, Jiaoshou need to accelerate his Bugatti Veyron. <br> <br>To simplify this problem, we just assume that only one police car ran after Jiaoshou. And Bugatti Veyron&#x2019;s speed is vx. The police car&#x2019;s speed is vy. v is a function of first degree or a constant, as the form of a*m+b. In this form, m means the minute that the car has run.<br>Now Jiaoshou is S meters ahead. Jiaoshou like to know if he could escape from the chase. He want you to write a program to solve this problem.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several tests.
