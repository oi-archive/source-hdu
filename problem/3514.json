The queen was known as an oppressive ruler.People in the country suffered from heavy taxes and forced labor. So some young people decided to form a revolutionary army and fight against the queen. Now, they besieged the palace and have just rushed into the entrance.<br><br>Your task is to write a program to determine whether the queen can escape or will be caught by the army.<br><br>Here is detailed description.<br>&#x25CF;&#xA0;&#xA0;The palace can be considered as grid squares.<br>&#x25CF;&#xA0;&#xA0;The queen and the army move alternately. The queen moves first.<br>&#x25CF;&#xA0;&#xA0;At each of their turns, they either move to an adjacent cell or stay at the same cell.<br>&#x25CF;&#xA0;&#xA0;Each of them must follow the optimal strategy.<br>&#x25CF;&#xA0;&#xA0;If the queen and the army are at the same cell, the queen will be caught by the army immediately.<br>&#x25CF;&#xA0;&#xA0;If the queen is at any of exit cells alone after the army&#x2019;s turn, the queen can escape from the army.<br>&#x25CF;&#xA0;&#xA0;There may be cases in which the queen cannot escape but won&#x2019;t be caught by the army forever,<br>under their optimal strategies.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input describes a map of the palace.
