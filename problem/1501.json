The first two strings can be mixed arbitrarily, but each must stay in its original order.<br><br>For example, consider forming &quot;tcraete&quot; from &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;tree&quot;:<br><br>String A: cat<br>String B: tree<br>String C: tcraete<br><br><br>As you can see, we can form the third string by alternating characters from the two strings. As a second example, consider forming &quot;catrtee&quot; from &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;tree&quot;:<br><br>String A: cat<br>String B: tree<br>String C: catrtee<br><br><br>Finally, notice that it is impossible to form &quot;cttaree&quot; from &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;tree&quot;.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a single positive integer from 1 through 1000.
