Fortunately, they have invented a clock with several pointers. They have N pointers which can move round the clock. Every pointer ticks once per second, and the i-th pointer move to the starting position after i times of ticks. The wise of the byte island decide to define a day as the time interval between the initial time and the first time when all the pointers moves to the position exactly the same as the initial time.<br>The wise of the island decide to choose some of the N pointers to make the length of the day greater or equal to M. They want to know how many different ways there are to make it possible.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are a lot of test cases.
