There are many strange stars in it, and we call them S-stars. Each three of them, such as A, B, C, can form an opaque triangle area ABC, and the area can absorb the light inside O-ABC for the point light source O which made O can only light the space except an infinite triangular file shaped space whose boundaries are ray OA, OB and OC.<br><br>In order to know the size of the area that a point light source O can light at a specific direction, we normally choose a plane P as reference, consider O&#x2019;s invisible area in P. If the area size is infinite or 0, we consider the direction as a bad one. We take this direction as a reference only if the area size is finite and non-zero.<br><br>Then we&#x2019;ll give you another set of normal stars, we&#x2019;d like to know the percentage of those couldn&#x2019;t be lighted among all the normal stars.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Multiple cases, no more than 100, test case ends with four zeros.<br>All numbers are integers, in each case:<br>Line 1: a, b, c and d, represent the reference plane: ax+by+cz=d;<br>Line 2: n (0&lt;n&lt;=100), number of S-stars<br>Line 3 &#x2013; n+2: x, y and z, coordinate of each S-star<br>Line n+3: x0, y0 and z0, coordinate of point light source O<br>Line n+4: m (0&lt;m&lt;100), number of normal stars<br>Line n+5 &#x2013; n+m+4: x, y and z, coordinate of each normal star<br><br>Notice: S-star and normal star may coincide.
