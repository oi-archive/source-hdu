You need to find out sum total of them.<br>Tom doesn&apos;t know how to do, he wants you to help him.<br>Because the number may be very large, output the answer to the problem modulo ${10}^{9}+7$.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Multi test cases(about 20).
