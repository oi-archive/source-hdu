One day he turned into a learner of graph theory.  <br>He learned some algorithms of minimum spanning tree. Then he had a good idea, he wanted to find the maximum spanning tree with bit operation AND.  <br>A spanning tree is composed by $n-1$ edges. Each two points of $n$ points can reach each other. The size of a spanning tree is generated by bit operation AND with values of $n-1$ edges.  <br>Now he wants to figure out the maximum spanning tree.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer $T(1 \\le T \\le 5)$, the number of test cases.  <br>For each test case, the first line contains two integers $n, m(2 \\le n \\le  300000, 1 \\le m \\le 300000)$, denoting the number of points and the number of edge respectively.  <br>Then $m$ lines followed, each line contains three integers $x, y, w(1 \\le x, y \\le n, 0 \\le w \\le 10^9)$, denoting an edge between $x, y$ with value $w$.  <br>The number of test case with $n, m &gt; 100000$ will not exceed 1.  <br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print a line contained an integer represented the answer.
