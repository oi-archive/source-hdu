The process continues until a single-digit number is reached.<br>For example, the digital root of 65536 is 7, because 6+5+5+3+6=25 and 2+5=7.<br>The digital root of an interval is digital root of the sum of all numbers in that interval.<br><br>Consider a sequence A<sub>1</sub>,A<sub>2</sub>,A<sub>3</sub>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;A<sub>n</sub>, your task is to answer some queries[l,r]. For each query, tell the biggest five different digital roots among all continuous subintervals of interval[l,r]","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"In the first line of the input , we have one integer T indicating the number of test cases.
