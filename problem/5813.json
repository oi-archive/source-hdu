And now in this problem, you are being a city architect!<br>A city with N towns (numbered 1 through N) is under construction. You, the architect, are being responsible for designing how these towns are connected by one-way roads. Each road connects two towns, and passengers can travel through in one direction.<br><br>For business purpose, the connectivity between towns has some requirements. You are given N non-negative integers a1 .. aN. For 1 &lt;= i &lt;= N, passenger start from town i, should be able to reach exactly ai towns (directly or indirectly, not include i itself). To prevent confusion on the trip, every road should be different, and cycles (one can travel through several roads and back to the starting point) should not exist.<br><br>Your task is constructing such a city. Now it&apos;s your showtime!<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is an integer T (T &lt;= 10), indicating the number of test case.
