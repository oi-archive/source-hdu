To solve the traffic problem, the mayor plans to build a RTQS (Real Time Query System) to monitor all traffic situations. City C is made up of N crossings and M roads, and each road connects two crossings. All roads are bidirectional. One of the important tasks of RTQS is to answer some queries about route-choice problem. Specifically, the task is to find the crossings which a driver MUST pass when he is driving from one given road to another given road.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.<br>For each test case:<br>The first line contains two integers N and M, representing the number of the crossings and roads.<br>The next M lines describe the roads.
