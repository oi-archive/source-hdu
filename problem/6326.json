The battlefield consists of $n$ intersections, labeled by $1,2,...,n$, connected by $n-1$ bidirectional roads. Little Q is now at the $1$-th intersection, with $X$ units of health point(HP).<br>There is a monster at each intersection except $1$. When Little Q moves to the $k$-th intersection, he must battle with the monster at the $k$-th intersection. During the battle, he will lose $a_i$ units of HP. And when he finally beats the monster, he will be awarded $b_i$ units of HP. Note that when HP becomes negative($&lt;0$), the game will over, so never let this happen. There is no need to have a battle at the same intersection twice because monsters do not have extra life.<br>When all monsters are cleared, Little Q will win the game. Please write a program to compute the minimum initial HP that can lead to victory.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T(1\\leq T\\leq2000)$, denoting the number of test cases.<br>In each test case, there is one integer $n(2\\leq n\\leq 100000)$ in the first line, denoting the number of intersections.<br>For the next $n-1$ lines, each line contains two integers $a_i,b_i(0\\leq a_i,b_i\\leq 10^9)$, describing monsters at the $2,3,...,n$-th intersection.<br>For the next $n-1$ lines, each line contains two integers $u$ and $v$, denoting a bidirectional road between the $u$-th intersection and the $v$-th intersection.<br>It is guaranteed that $\\sum n\\leq 10^6$.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print a single line containing an integer, denoting the minimum initial HP.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\t\n4\t\n2 6\n5 4\n6 2\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2018+Multi-University+Training+Contest+3&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2018 Multi-University Training Contest 3 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
