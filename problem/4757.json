This time, they decide to do something on a tree which is a kind of graph that there is only one path from node to node. First, Zero will give One an tree and every node in this tree has a value. Then, Zero will ask One a series of queries. Each query contains three parameters: x, y, z which mean that he want to know the maximum value produced by z xor each value on the path from node x to node y (include node x, node y). Unfortunately, One has no idea in this question. So he need you to solve it.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"&#xA0;&#xA0;There are several test cases and the cases end with EOF.
