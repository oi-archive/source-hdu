She needs to manage the traffic in this city. To manage the traffic is too hard for her. So she needs your help.   <br>You are given the map of the city &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; an undirected connected weighted graph with $N$ nodes and $N$ edges, and you have to finish $Q$ missions. Each mission consists of $3$ integers $OP$, $X$ and $Y$.    <br>When $OP=0$, you need to modify the weight of the $X_{th}$ edge to $Y$.    <br>When $OP=1$, you need to calculate the length of the shortest path from node $X$ to node $Y$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer $T$, the number of test cases.   <br>Each test case starts with a line containing two integers $N$ and $Q$, the number of nodes (and edges) and the number of queries. $(3 \\leq N \\leq 10^5) (1 \\leq Q \\leq 10^5)$   <br>Each of the following $N$ lines contain the description of the edges.
