Little Q does this, too. What&apos;s more? He even changes the original words. Formally, we can assume what somebody said as a string $S$ whose length is $n$. He will choose a continuous substring of $S$(or choose nothing), and remove it, then merge the remain parts into a complete one without changing order, marked as $S&apos;$. For example, he might remove &apos;&apos;not&apos;&apos; from the string &apos;&apos;I am not SB.&apos;&apos;, so that the new string $S&apos;$ will be &apos;&apos;I am SB.&apos;&apos;, which makes it funnier.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C762-1002-1.jpg\"></center><br><br>After doing lots of such things, Little Q finds out that string $T$ occurs as a continuous substring of $S&apos;$ very often.<br><br>Now given strings $S$ and $T$, Little Q has $k$ questions. Each question is, given $L$ and $R$, Little Q will remove a substring so that the remain parts are $S[1..i]$ and $S[j..n]$, what is the expected times that $T$ occurs as a continuous substring of $S&apos;$ if he choose every possible pair of $(i,j)(1\\leq i\\leq L,R\\leq j\\leq n)$ equiprobably? Your task is to find the answer $E$, and report $E\\times L\\times (n-R+1)$ to him.<br><br>Note : When counting occurrences, $T$ can overlap with each other.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $C(1\\leq C\\leq15)$, denoting the number of test cases.<br><br>In each test case, there are $3$ integers $n,m,k(1\\leq n\\leq 50000,1\\leq m\\leq 100,1\\leq k\\leq 50000)$ in the first line, denoting the length of $S$, the length of $T$ and the number of questions.<br><br>In the next line, there is a string $S$ consists of $n$ lower-case English letters.<br><br>Then in the next line, there is a string $T$ consists of $m$ lower-case English letters.<br><br>In the following $k$ lines, there are $2$ integers $L,R(1\\leq L&lt;R\\leq n)$ in each line, denoting a question.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each question, print a single line containing an integer, denoting the answer.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n8 5 4\niamnotsb\niamsb\n4 7\n3 7\n3 8\n2 7</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n1\n0\n0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2017+Multi-University+Training+Contest+-+Team+4&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2017 Multi-University Training Contest - Team 4 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
