There are n (2&lt;=n&lt;=10<sup>4</sup>) members in the team. In order to let everybody participate in the race, each member should run at least d (0&lt;=d&lt;=10) meters. Besides that, everyone can run arbitrary distance. The whole length of the track is L (1&lt;=L&lt;=10<sup>5</sup>) meters.<br><br>For the i<sup>th</sup> member in the team, if he is in a good mood, then it takes him t<sub>i</sub> seconds (1&lt;=t<sub>i</sub>&lt;=4&#xD7;10<sup>4</sup>) to run one meter. If he is in a bad mood, then it takes him s<sub>i</sub> (1&lt;=s<sub>i</sub>&lt;=4&#xD7;10<sup>4</sup>, 1&lt;=t<sub>i</sub>&lt;=s<sub>i</sub>) seconds to run one meter.<br><br>As the coach of the team, you can assign the running distance of each member in advance. Suppose that, it takes S seconds for the team to complete the relay race if all the members are in bad moods and it takes T seconds for the team to complete the relay race if all the members are in good moods. You do want to have a good score. But you don&#x2019;t want to have a very bad score even if someone is in a bad mood. So you want to know the minimum value of T on condition that S should not be larger than W (1&lt;=W&lt;=2147483647).","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input begins with a line containing an integer, indicating the number of test cases. There are no more than 100 test cases.<br><br>For each case, the first line begins with four integers --- the above mentioned n, d, L and W. Then n lines follow, each representing a member. Each line contains two integers s and t, meaning that the member spends s seconds to run one meter when he/she is in a bad mood, and spends t seconds to run one meter when he/she is in a good mood.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, if you cannot find a proper way to assign the running distance of each member, output a string &#x201C;No solution&#x201D; in a line.
