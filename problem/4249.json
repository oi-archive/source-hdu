Mr. G removes some of the digits and makes it look like &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;1?3+??1=44?&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;. Here &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;?&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; denotes removed digits. After Mr. B realizes some digits are missing, he wants to recover them. Unfortunately, there may be more than one way to complete the equation. For example &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;1?3+??1=44?&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; can be completed to &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;123+321=444&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; , &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;143+301=444&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; and many other possible solutions. Your job is to determine the number of different possible solutions.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Each test case describes a single line with an equation like a+b=c which contains exactly one plus sign &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;+&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; and one equal sign &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;=&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; with some question mark &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;?&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; represent missing digits. You may assume a, b and c are non-negative integers, and the length of each number is no more than 9. In the other words, the equation will contain three integers less than 1,000,000,000.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, display a single line with its case number and the number of possible solutions to recover the equation.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">7+1?=1?\n?1+?1=22</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case 1: 3\nCase 2: 1\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nThere are three solutions for the first case:\n7+10=17, 7+11=18, 7+12=19\nThere is only one solution for the second case:\n11+11=22\nNote that 01+21=22 is not a valid solution because extra leading zeros are not allowed.\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=Fudan+Local+Programming+Contest+2012&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> Fudan Local Programming Contest 2012 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
