This number may be huge, so you are only to print it modulo 10^9 + 9.<br>Note that good numbers should be positive and should not have any leading zeroes.<br>For example, suppose K = 3 and P = 2, good numbers are 222(8), 444(8) and 666(8). 111(8) is not good because it is not the multiple of 2. 102(8) is not good because 1 occurs once, not multiple of 3.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple (at most 100) test cases.
