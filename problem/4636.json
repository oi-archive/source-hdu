The football is totally white in the beginning and L has to color some of its faces into black (maybe zero). Look at the picture below, the 32 faces of a football are numbered from 1 to 32. Two faces are considered connected if and only if they share a same side such like 12 and 13 as well as 29 and 30. Each step L can choose some connected faces of the football and color all these faces into black or white no matter what color it used to be. For example, L can color the faces 2, 3, 4 and 5 at the same time, but he can&#x2019;t color the faces 26 and 29 at the same time. <br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C457-1005-2.jpg\"></center><br>Now give the target state of the football, your task is calculating the minimum steps that L needs to do.
