Yuta is worrying about this situation, so he gives Rikka some math tasks to practice. There is one of them:<br><br>Correct parentheses sequences can be defined recursively as follows:<br>1.The empty string &quot;&quot; is a correct sequence.<br>2.If &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are correct sequences, then &quot;XY&quot; (the concatenation of X and Y) is a correct sequence.<br>3.If &quot;X&quot; is a correct sequence, then &quot;(X)&quot; is a correct sequence.<br>Each correct parentheses sequence can be derived using the above rules.<br>Examples of correct parentheses sequences include &quot;&quot;, &quot;()&quot;, &quot;()()()&quot;, &quot;(()())&quot;, and &quot;(((())))&quot;.<br><br>Now Yuta has a parentheses sequence $S$, and he wants Rikka to choose two different position $i,j$ and swap $S_i,S_j$. <br><br>Rikka likes correct parentheses sequence. So she wants to know if she can change S to a correct parentheses sequence after this operation.<br><br>It is too difficult for Rikka. Can you help her?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a number t(1&lt;=t&lt;=1000), the number of the testcases.
