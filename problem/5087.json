This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique.<br>---Wikipedia<br><br>Today, LIS takes revenge on you, again. You mission is not calculating the length of longest increasing subsequence, but the length of the second longest increasing subsequence.<br>Two subsequence is different if and only they have different length, or have at least one different element index in the same place. And second longest increasing subsequence of sequence S indicates the second largest one while sorting all the increasing subsequences of S by its length.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer T, indicating the number of test cases. <br><br>Each test case begins with an integer N, indicating the length of the sequence.
