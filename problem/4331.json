Now you are given an image which is a N * N matrix and there are only 0s and 1s in the matrix. And we are interested in the squares in whose four edges there is no 0s. So it&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s your task to find how many such squares in the image.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer T (1&lt;=T&lt;=10) which means the number of test cases. <br>For each test cases, the first line is one integer N (1&lt;=N&lt;=1000) which is the size of the image. Then there are N lines and each line has N integers each of which is either 0 or 1.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, please output a line which is &quot;Case X: Y&quot;, X means the number of the test case and Y means the number of the squares we are interested in in the image.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n3\n1 1 0\n1 1 0\n0 0 0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case 1: 5</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2012+Multi-University+Training+Contest+4&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2012 Multi-University Training Contest 4 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
