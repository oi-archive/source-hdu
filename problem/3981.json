The Sacred Warrior&#x2019;s abilities revolve around shortening his own lifespan to spear his foes to burinng pieces.When we control the Sacred Warrior , we always want to give our enemies the most damage.So to simplify the problem,let&#x2019;s consider the Sacred Warrior&#x2019;s two skills as below:<br><br>(1) Burning Spear<br><br>When the Sacred Warrior use the Burning Spear to attack his enemy, follow things will happen in order in the current second:<br><br>1.the enemy gets physical hurt by a normal attatk.<br><br>2.if the enemy&#x2019;s burning degree BD is greater than zero,the enemy will gets BD*FI damage points.(at the beginning,the enemy&#x2019;s burning degree is zero).<br><br>3.the enemy&#x2019;s burning degree +1.<br><br>4.the remanent burning time become 6.<br><br>5.the Sacred Warrior&#x2019;s HP decrease by D. The Sacred Warrior can not kill himself(don&#x2019;t ask me why),that is,when the Sacred Warrior&#x2019;s HP is less than or equal to D, the Sacred Warrior can not use Burning Spear!<br><br>When the Sacred Warrior use a single normal attack instead of Burning Spear, follow things will happen in order in the current second:<br><br>1.the enemy gets physical hurt by the normal attack.<br><br>2.if the enemy&#x2019;s burning degree BD is greater than zero,the enemy will gets BD*FI damage points.(at the beginning,the enemy&#x2019;s burning degree is zero).<br><br>3.the remanent burning time decrease by 1.<br><br>4.if the remanent burning time is zero, then the enemy&#x2019;s burning degree become zero.<br><br>(2) Berserk&#x2019;s blood<br><br>The Sacred Warrior&#x2019;s base attack is A.<br><br>Whenever the Sacred Warrior&#x2019;HP reduce R ,his attack will increase U, it means the Sacred Warrior will get ((HS-HC) / R)*U extra attack.(round down for division, hs is the original HP and the hc is the current HP).<br><br>The normal attack NA is the sum of base attack and extra attack.<br><br>The enemy has a defence degree DEFi and it change every second(the reason is complicated,such as Weave,Meld,Gush,Natural Order,Mekansm and so on).Whenever the enemy is attacked by a normal attack(a single normal attack or the first part of Burning Spear), if the enemy&#x2019;s defence degree is greater than the normal attack, the enemy won&#x2019;t get any physical hurt(but the burning effect is still effective), otherwise the enemy will get NA-DEFi damage.(NA is the current normal attack and the DEFi is the current defence degree).<br><br>Every second The Sacred Warrior can choose using a single normal attack or Burning Spear to attack the enemy. But in order to make the most damage and lose too much HP is obviously not wise. So we use a evaluation function F=C - (HS-HE)*P to evaluate the fight. (hs is the original HP and the he is the HP after last second, C is the total damage he cause).Can you find the maximal F ?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single positive integer N( N &lt;= 20 ), indicates the number of test cases.<br><br>For each test case:<br><br>The first line contains eight integers T , HS , A , R , U , D , FI , P , T is the total time in seconds and the others is as described above.<br><br>The second line contains T integers , the i-th integer is the defence degree DEFi in i-th second.<br><br>0&lt; T &lt; 200 , 0&lt; HS &lt; 100 , 0 &lt; A &lt; 5000 , 0&lt; R &lt; HS , 3&lt;= D &lt;= 10 , 0 &lt;= U , FI , P &lt;1000<br><br>0 &lt;= DEFi &lt;3000","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print a line containing the test case number (beginning with 1) and the maximal F.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2 \n5 10 5 3 2 3 2 1 \n0 0 0 0 0 \n5 10 1 7 1 3 5 1 \n2 2 2 2 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 52 \nCase #2: 36\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nIn the first case:\n\nThe Sacred Warrior use burning spear in second 1,2 and 3, use single normal attack in second 4 and 5.\n\nTIME 0 1 2 3 4 5HP 10 7 4 1 1 1defence 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nnormal atk 0 5 7 9 11 11burning atk 0 0 2 4 6 6\n\nSo F=(5+7+9+11+11+0+2+4+6+6)-(10-1)*1=52;\n\nIn the second case:\n\nThe Sacred Warrior use burning spear in second 1,2 and 3, use single normal attack in second 4 and 5.\n\nTIME 0 1 2 3 4 5HP 10 7 4 1 1 1defence 0 2 2 2 2 2\n\nnormal atk 0 1 1 1 2 2burning atk 0 0 5 10 15 15\n\nBecause every second the DEFi is greater than or equal to the normal attack, so the normal attack is complete invalid.\n\nSo F=(0+5+10+15+15)-(10-1)*1=36;\nCached at 2011-08-25 16:03:45.\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2011+Multi-University+Training+Contest+14+-+Host+by+FZU&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2011 Multi-University Training Contest 14 - Host by FZU </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
