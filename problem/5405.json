But Teacher Mai thought this problem was too simple, sometimes naive. So she ask you for help.<br><br>She has a tree with $n$ vertices, numbered from $1$ to $n$. The weight of $i$-th node is $w_i$.<br><br>You need to support two kinds of operations: modification and query.<br><br>For a modification operation $u,w$, you need to change the weight of $u$-th node into $w$.<br><br>For a query operation $u,v$, you should output $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n f(i,j)$. If there is a vertex on the path from $u$ to $v$ and the path from $i$ to $j$ in the tree, $f(i,j)=w_iw_j$, otherwise $f(i,j)=0$. The number can be large, so print the number modulo $10^9+7$<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains two numbers $n,m(1\\leq n,m\\leq 10^5)$.<br><br>There are $n$ numbers in the next line, the $i$-th means $w_i(0\\leq w_i\\leq 10^9)$.<br><br>Next $n-1$ lines contain two numbers each, $u_i$ and $v_i$, that means that there is an edge between $u_i$ and $v_i$.<br><br>The following are $m$ lines.
