It is mathematics, but much harder than ordinary mathematics for primary school students. Teacher Liu is an Aoshu teacher.  He just comes out with a problem to test his students:<br><br>Given a serial of digits, you must put a &apos;=&apos; and none or some &apos;+&apos; between these digits and make an equation. Please find out how many equations you can get. For example, if the digits serial is &quot;1212&quot;, you can get 2 equations, they are &quot;12=12&quot; and &quot;1+2=1+2&quot;.  Please note that the digits only include 1 to 9, and every &apos;+&apos; must have a digit on its left side and right side. For example, &quot;+12=12&quot;, and &quot;1++1=2&quot; are illegal. Please note that &quot;1+11=12&quot; and &quot;11+1=12&quot; are different equations.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases.
