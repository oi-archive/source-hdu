Naruto&apos;s perseverance and passion attract him a lot, so does Naruto&apos;s skill &quot;Kagebunsin no jyutu&quot;(&#x4F0;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;). Actually, wyb knows more details about &quot;Kagebunsin no jyutu&quot; than most of us. When Naruto makes an new illusion(&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;), his Chakra will divide into two parts A and B, and increase Naruto&apos;s weariness value by absolutely value of (A - B). <br>For example, at first Naruto have 5 Chakra, then he makes an illusion who has 2 Chakra. So he left 3 Chakra, and increase his weariness value by 1 (3 - 2). If he make a new illusion again and give him 2 Chakra, then he only left 1 Chakra and his weariness value changes to 2. Naruto cannot make a new illusion unless his Chakra is bigger than 1. What&apos;s more, Naruto&apos;s illusion can also use &quot;Kagebunsin no jyutu&quot; and the weariness they gains will also return to Naruto himself.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C241-1007-1.jpg\"></center>  <br>Now Naruto wants to make as many illusions as he can because Kakashi Sensei wants to teach him a new Ninjyutsu(&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;) and minimum his weariness value.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains an integer T, indicating the number of test cases, then  T lines follow , each line contains a positive integer N, indicating the number of Naruto&apos;s Chakra.<br>0 &lt; N &lt; 10000000;<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each case ,output the minimum weariness value of Naruto when he makes the most illusions.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n5\n9</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=HDU+2009-10+Programming+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> HDU 2009-10 Programming Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
