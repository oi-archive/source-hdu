The playground can be considered as a n&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;m grid. The coordinate of the west north corner is (1,1) , and the coordinate of the east south corner is (n,m).<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/3687-1.gif\"></center> <br>When training, every students must stand on a line intersection and all students must form a n&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;n square. The figure above shows a 3&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;8 playground with 9 students training on it. The thick black dots stand for the students. You can see that 9 students form a 3&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;3 square.<br><br>After training, the students will get a time to relax and move away as they like. To make it easy for their masters to control the training, the students are only allowed to move in the east-west direction. When the next training begins, the master would gather them to form a n&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;n square again, and the position of the square doesn&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t matter. Of course, no student is allowed to stand outside the playground.<br><br>You are given the coordinates of each student when they are having a rest. Your task is to figure out the minimum sum of distance that all students should move to form a n&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;n square.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are at most 100 test cases. <br>For each test case: <br>The first line of one test case contain two integers n,m.
