But the process of making this kind of special cakes is very complex. One day, his friend Kayaking gave him a formulation which allows WNJXYK to produce one special cake with exact one kiwi in no time. Now let us have a big party over anyone&#x2019;s imagination. <br>To simply this question we can assume that WNJXYK invited m friends to his house and he only had n kiwis this time. He wanted to produce special cakes with Kayaking&#x2019;s formulation and give them to his friends.<br>Usually, it maybe not possible for people to get exactly same number of cakes in some situations. We can assume that people who received the most one get x cakes and people who received the least get y cakes. WNJXYK wondered that what is the minimal value of |x-y|?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input starts with one line contains exactly one positive integer T which is the number of test cases.<br>Each test case contains one line with exactly two positive integer n,m which has been explained above.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one line containing &#x201C;y&#x201D; where y is the number of minimal difference.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n5 5\n3 10\n6 7</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">0\n1\n1\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\n1&lt;=T&lt;=100,1&lt;=n,m&lt;=1000\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2018+%BA%DA%C1%FA%BD%AD%CA%A1%B4%F3%D1%A7%C9%FA%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%BE%BA%C8%FC&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2018 &#x9ED1;&#x9F99;&#x6C5F;&#x7701;&#x5927;&#x5B66;&#x751F;&#x7A0B;&#x5E8F;&#x8BBE;&#x8BA1;&#x7ADE;&#x8D5B; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
