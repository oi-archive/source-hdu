So Cuber QQ decided to play a little game with this Quber CC, and their bet was, whoever lost the game would have to do something really humiliating in front of everyone in the QQ group.<br><br>The game is like this. It&apos;s a traditional card game. Cuber QQ will play first. Cuber QQ, and his opponent (Quber CC of course), will each possess a hand of cards. There is no number (or rank if you prefer) on the card, but only color (or suit if you prefer). The players play cards alternatively, each player can only play one card in each turn. An additional rule is that, a player must <b>not</b> play a card with the same color as any card which has been played by his/her opponent, but coincidence with a card played by himself/herself is acceptable.<br><br>The player who can&apos;t play any card loses. This might due to the fact that he/she has cards but he cannot play any due to the game rules, or he doesn&apos;t have any cards any more. As a game played between civilized people, the game will be played in a completely transparent manner, where Cuber QQ and Quber CC know exactly what&apos;s left in their opponent&apos;s hand.<br><br>It&apos;s now a game attracting thousands of eyes, and you decided to invent a predictor whose job is to predict &quot;who will win if both players play smart&quot; to excite the audience.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input is a positive integer $t$, denoting the number of test cases.<br><br>Then follows $t$ test cases, each test case starts with space-separated integers $n$, $m$, $p$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 10^5$, $p \\in \\{1, 2\\}$). Generally speaking, this should be followed by two lines of integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$, denoting the colors of Cuber QQ&apos;s hand and Quber CC&apos;s hand, respectively.
