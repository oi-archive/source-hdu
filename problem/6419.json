We can consider each student as a circle with radius $r$ and center $(a_i,b_i)$.<br><br>There is only one building in the school. This building can be considered as a simple polygon with $n$ vertices $(x_i,y_i)$. To get out of the rain, the students need to run into the building as quickly as possible. <br><br>As a member of the students, Rikka wants to calculate the minimum possible running distance for each student.<br><br>The following are some supplements to this task:<br>1. You may assume that students will not interact with each other and the circles may overlap.<br>2. A student is inside the building if and only if the circle is completely inside the simple polygon.<br>3. Students can run in any direction, and the running distance is the Euclidean distance between the initial position and the target position of the center.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer $t(1 \\leq t \\leq 10)$, the numebr of the testcases.<br><br>For each testcase, the first line contains three integers $n,m,R(3 \\leq n,m \\leq 200, 1 \\leq R \\leq 10^6)$.<br><br>Then $n$ lines follows, each line contains two integers $(x_i,y_i)(|x_i|,|y_i| \\leq 10^6)$, which describe the simple polygon in counter-clockwise.<br><br>Then $m$ lines follows, each line contains two integers $(a_i,b_i)(|a_i|,|b_i| \\leq 10^6)$, which describe the initial position of the students.<br><br>The input guarantees that it is possible for each student to run into the building.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each query, let $w$ be the minimum running distance of the student.
