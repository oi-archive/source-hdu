Orac and Slime operate them by turns in the game. For each operation, they have two choices:<br><br>1. Pick up any number of stones from a certain group;<br><br>2. Pick up $x$ stones from the first group and $y$ from the second group, which $x,y$ satisfy $|x-y|\\le k$. $k$ is a given constant.<br><br>Notice that not picking up any stone in an operation is not allowed. If there is no stone left in both groups at the beginning of one&apos;s turn, he loses the game. <br><br>Orac would like to know whether there exists a winning strategy for him if he operates first. They will play many times, so he will make multiple queries.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains one integer $T$($1\\le T\\le 10^5$), which stands for the number of queries that Orac makes.<br>In the following $T$ lines, each line contains three integer $a,b,k$($1\\le a\\le 10^8, 1\\le b\\le 10^8, 0\\le k\\le 10^8$).","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"The output contains $T$ lines, with an integer $0$ or $1$ in each line, stand for there exist/not exist a winning strategy for the given situation.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4\n1 2 0\n2 4 0\n1 2 1\n2 6 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">0\n1\n1\n0\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nIn the first query, if Orac picks up all the stones from a group, Slime will pick up all the stones from the other group, and if Orac picks up a stone from the second group, Slime will pick up a stone from both groups.\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2020+Multi-University+Training+Contest+9&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2020 Multi-University Training Contest 9 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
