And they want to make the number of candies the same by doing some taking and giving operations. More specifically, every two adjacent soda $x$ and $y$ can do one of the following operations only once:<br>  1. $x$-th soda gives $y$-th soda a candy if he has one;<br>  2. $y$-th soda gives $x$-th soda a candy if he has one;<br>  3. they just do nothing.<br><br>Now you are to determine whether it is possible and give a sequence of operations.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
