Most of them like to eat human beings, so they are called &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;The Ogre Magi&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, but there is an special one whose favorite food is hamburger, having been jeered by the others as &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;The Hamburger Magi&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;.<br>Let&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s give The Hamburger Magi a nickname &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;HamMagi&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, HamMagi don&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t only love to eat but also to make hamburgers, he makes N hamburgers, and he gives these each hamburger a value as Vi, and each will cost him Ei energy, (He can use in total M energy each day). In addition, some hamburgers can&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t be made directly, for example, HamMagi can make a &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Big Mac&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; only if &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;New Orleams roasted burger combo&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; and &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Mexican twister combo&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; are all already made. Of course, he will only make each kind of hamburger once within a single day. Now he wants to know the maximal total value he can get after the whole day&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s hard work, but he is too tired so this is your task now!<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line consists of an integer C(C&lt;=50), indicating the number of test cases.<br>The first line of each case consists of two integers N,E(1&lt;=N&lt;=15,0&lt;=E&lt;=100) , indicating there are N kinds of hamburgers can be made and the initial energy he has.<br>The second line of each case contains N integers V1,V2&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;VN, (Vi&lt;=1000)indicating the value of each kind of hamburger.<br>The third line of each case contains N integers E1,E2&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;EN, (Ei&lt;=100)indicating the energy each kind of hamburger cost.<br>Then N lines follow, each line starts with an integer Qi, then Qi integers follow, indicating the hamburgers that making ith hamburger needs.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each line, output an integer indicating the maximum total value HamMagi can get.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n4 90\n243 464 307 298 \n79 58 0 72\n3 2 3 4\n2 1 4\n1 1\n0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">298</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=HDU+2009-10+Programming+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> HDU 2009-10 Programming Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
