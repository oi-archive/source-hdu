As we all know, whenever you chase a beautiful girl, there&apos;ll always be an opponent, or a rival. In order to take one step ahead in this chasing process, Daizhenyang decided to prove to the girl that he&apos;s better and more intelligent than any other chaser. So he arranged a simple game: Coin Flip Game. He invited the girl to be the judge.<br>In this game, n coins are set in a row, where n is smaller than 10^8. They took turns to flip coins, to flip one coin from head-up to tail-up or the other way around. Each turn, one can choose 1, 2 or 3 coins to flip, but the rightmost selected must be head-up before flipping operation. If one cannot make such a flip, he lost.<br>As we all know, Daizhenyang is a very smart guy (He&apos;s famous for his 26 problems and Graph Theory Unified Theory-Network Flow does it all ). So he will always choose the optimal strategy to win the game. And it&apos;s a very very bad news for all the competitors.<br>But the girl did not want to see that happen so easily, because she&apos;s not sure about her feelings towards him.

Your task is to help her determine whether her arrangement is a losable situation for Daizhenyang.<br>For simplicity, you are only told the position of head-up coins.
