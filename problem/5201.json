He and his offspring live in Mountain of Flowers and Fruits. One day, his sons get $n$ peaches. And there are $m$ monkeys (including GoKu), they are numbered from $1$ to $m$, GoKu&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s number is 1. GoKu wants to distribute these peaches to themselves. Since GoKu is the King, so he must get the most peach. GoKu wants to know how many different ways he can distribute these peaches. For example n=2, m=3, there is only one way to distribute these peach: 2 0 0.<br><br>When given $n$ and $m$, you are expected to calculate how many different ways GoKu can distribute these peaches. Answer may be very large, output the answer modular $1000000007$ instead.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
