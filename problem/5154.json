By knowing all the m dependencies, Harry wants to know if the computer can finish all the n processes.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases, you should process to the end of file.<br>For each test case, there are two numbers n m on the first line, indicates the number processes and the number of dependencies. $1 \\leq n \\leq 100, 1 \\leq m \\leq 10000$<br>The next following m lines, each line contains two numbers a b, indicates a dependencies (a, b). $1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Output one line for each test case. <br>If the computer can finish all the process print &quot;YES&quot; (Without quotes).<br>Else print &quot;NO&quot; (Without quotes).","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3 2\n3 1\n2 1\n3 3\n3 2\n2 1\n1 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">YES\nNO</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=BestCoder+Round+%2325&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> BestCoder Round #25 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
