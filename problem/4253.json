They both are planning to build cables between cities. Obviously, the government wants to connect all the cities in minimum costs. So the minister of finance Mr. B wants to choose some of the <br>cable plans from the two companies and calculate the minimum cost needed to connect all the cities. Mr. B knows that N-1 cables should be built in order to connect all N cities of China. For some honorable reason, Mr. B should choose K cables from the China Telecom and the rest N-1-K cables from the China Unicom. Your job is to help Mr. B determine which cables should be built and the minimum cost to build them. You may assume that the solution always exists.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Each test case starts with a line containing the number of cities N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 50,000), number of cable plans M (N-1 &lt;= M &lt;= 100,000) and the number of required <br>cables from China Telecom K (0 &lt;= K &lt;= N-1).
