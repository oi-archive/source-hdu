A message is concealed in the presentation of text, rather than its content. <br>As we all know, each letter has its position in the alphabet, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;A&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; is 0, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;B&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; is 1, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;C&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; is 2&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;and so on. And each number can be represented in binary code, for example, 2 is &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;10&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; in binary system. Then we expand the binary code to five digits by adding leading zeros, then 10 becomes 00010. Now we can use this number to encode. To simplify the question, we define the rules as below:<br>0 corresponds to a random uppercase letter and 1 corresponds to a random number, so after encoding, 00010 ( &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;C&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; ) is transformed to ABC1D or JUG9N. <br>To decode, do the opposite way around.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a positive number l, represents the length of the encoded string.
