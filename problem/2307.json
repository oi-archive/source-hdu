A string is a necklace if it is the lexicographically smallest among all its cyclic rotations. For instance, for the string 01011 the cyclic rotations are (10110,01101,11010,10101,01011), and furthermore 01011 is the smallest string and hence, a necklace. <br>Any string S can be written in a unique way as a concatenation S = T1T2 . . . Tk of necklaces Ti such that Ti+1 &lt; Ti for all i = 1, . . . , k - 1, and TiTi+1 is not a necklace for any i = 1, . . . , k - 1. This representation is called the necklace decomposition of the string S, and your task is to find it. <br>The relation &lt; on two strings is the lexicographical order and has the usual interpretation: A &lt; B if A is a proper prefix of B or if A is equal to B in the first j - 1 positions but smaller in the jth position for some j. For instance, 001 &lt; 0010 and 1101011 &lt; 1101100","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"On the first line of the input is a single positive integer n, telling the number of test scenarios to follow.
