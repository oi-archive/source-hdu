In order to train them, he holds N * (N - 1) / 2 competitions and asks the monsters to fight with each other. Any two monsters fight in exactly one competition, in which one of them beat the other. If monster A beats monster B, we say A is stronger than B. Note that the &#x201C;stronger than&#x201D; relation is not transitive. For example, it is possible that A beats B, B beats C but C beats A.<br><br>After finishing all the competitions, Mr. Chopsticks divides all the monsters into two teams T1 and T2, containing M and N &#x2013; M monsters respectively, where each monster is in exactly one team. Mr. Chopsticks considers a team of monsters powerful if there is a way to arrange them in a queue (A1, A2, &#x2026;, Am) such that monster Ai is stronger than monster Aj for any 1&lt;=i&lt;j&lt;=m. Now Mr. Chopsticks wants to check whether T1 and T2 are both powerful, and if so, he wants to select k monsters from T2 to join T1 such that the selected monsters together with all the monsters in T1 can still form a powerful team and k is as large as possible. Could you help him?<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains multiple test cases. Each case begins with two integers N and M (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000, 1 &lt;= M &lt; N), indicating the number of monsters Mr. Chopsticks keeps and the number of monsters in T1 respectively. The following N lines, each contain N integers, where the jth integer in the ith line is 1 if the ith monster beats the jth monster; otherwise, it is 0. It is guaranteed that the ith integer in the jth line is 0 iff the jth integer in the ith line is 1. The ith integer in the ith line is always 0. The last line of each case contains M distinct integers, each between 1 and N inclusively, representing the monsters in T1. The input is terminated by N = M = 0.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each case, if both T1 and T2 are powerful, output &#x201C;YES&#x201D; and the maximum k; otherwise, output &#x201C;NO&#x201D;.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3 2\n0 1 1\n0 0 1\n0 0 0\n3 1\n4 3\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0\n1 2 3\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0\n1 2\n0 0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">YES 1\nNO\nYES 1\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nIn the third example, Mr. Chopsticks can let the monster numbered 4 from T2 join into T1 to form a queue (1, 2, 4).\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"SYSU","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2016+Multi-University+Training+Contest+7&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2016 Multi-University Training Contest 7 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
