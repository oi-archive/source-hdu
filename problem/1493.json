You can get a lot of pleasure from it, although it does not have a real life and it calls for huge patience to take care of it. There is a place called QQpet exploratory park in the world. Every week, you can get a chance to have a joy there for free. The whole park contains 61 grids in a line, numbered from 0 to 60. Ten of them are important grids which will touch off ( &#x5F15;&#x53D1; ) an incident when the pet stands on. They are 5, 12, 22, 29, 33, 38, 42, 46, 50 and 55. Your pet is standing on the gird of number 0 in the beginning. You can toss the die ( &#x63B7;&#x9AB0;&#x5B50; ) 10 times. Each time, the pet goes ahead n steps which n is the number from the die ( n &#x2208;{ 1, 2, &#x2026;, 6 } ). If your RP is great enough( calls RPG for short ), you will get many surprises in the important grids, such as some yuanbao( the money in QQpet world ), an improvement of your pet&apos;s ability, and the most attractive gift-package. Now, your task is to calculate the probability(&#x6982;&#x7387;) of touching each important grid.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/c48-1003-1.jpg\"></center><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer t&#x2013; determining the number of datasets.
