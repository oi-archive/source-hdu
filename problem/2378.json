These are often small amounts, but because Philip hates coins, his wallet contains only banknotes. Therefore he usually can&apos;t pay the amount exactly. Since he hates coins, he also doesn&#x2019;t allow his friends to return them as change. He does allow for banknotes as change though. <br><br>To accomodate for this problem, he and his friends came up with the following idea: let&apos;s pay with pieces of banknotes. To make the cutting easy, they only cut banknotes in two equally-sized pieces, cut those pieces in two pieces, and so on. This yields a much larger range of amounts that can be paid. Philip wonders which ones exactly. <br><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"On the first line an integer t (1 &lt;= t &lt;= 100): the number of test cases.
