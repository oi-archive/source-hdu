For example, the sequence { 1, 4, 6, 5, 2, 1 } can be &apos;cut&apos; into { 1, 4, 6 } and { 6, 5, 2, 1 }. The two parts share the 6(see the following graph), and the first sequence is sorted in ascending order while the second sequence is sorted in descending order.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C128-1007-1.jpg\"></center><br>You are given a sequence of numbers.
