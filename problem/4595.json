For instance, 123 is similar to 321 but 12 is not similar to 120.<br>A sequence can be called &#x201C;similar sequence&#x201D; if this sequence has only one pair of &#x2018;&#x2019;similar&#x2019;&#x2019; numbers.<br>Now, Zero writes a series of integers and he needs you to answer his queries online. For each query, he gives you two integers l and r, which represent the two endpoints of a segment.
