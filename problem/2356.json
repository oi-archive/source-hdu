This was the first time that Rome had been taken by foreign troops in eight hundred years.<br><br>You will simulate a considerably less bloody (and less realistic) rout of soldiers by a potentially overwhelming force.<br><br>Consider a group of invaders of strength I, and an opposing force of strength J, with distance D between them and a defensive stronghold of strength<br>S. The Routing Force F of the invaders can be calculated as their strength times the distance:<br><br>F = ID<br><br>and the Blocking Force B of the defenders can be calculated as their strength times the square of their defenses:<br><br>B = JS<sup>2</sup><br><br>If F is less than or equal to B, the invaders&apos; rout fails, and they are driven off. If F is greater than B, the rout is successful, all defenders of the<br>stronghold are driven off, and the invaders can continue. However, their strength is reduced by removing a fraction equal to the ratio of the<br>defenders&apos; Blocking Force to their Routing Force for that attack. The resulting number should be rounded up to the nearest integer, to ensure that a<br>successful rout leaves at least one soldier:<br><br>I<sub>new</sub> = ?I(1 -  B/F)?<br><br>If the invaders make it through a stronghold, its location is considered the starting point for calculations regarding the next group of defenders, and so<br>on, until either the invading force makes it all the way through the defenders or is completely routed.<br><br>Your goal is to determine whether or not a given invading force can make it through a particular gauntlet of defenders.<br><br>For the purposes of simplification, all defending strongholds in this simulation are considered to be in a straight line from the starting position of the<br>invaders, and must be encountered in order from nearest to furthest away. No strongholds will be in the same location in a given set of data.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer N (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 100) indicating the number of data sets.
