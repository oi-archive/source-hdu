In fact, there are one hundred sixteen E&#x2019;s on this very page ... no, make that one hundred twenty one. Indeed, when spelling out integers it is interesting to see which ones do NOT use the letter &#x201C;E&#x201D;. For example 6030 (six thousand thirty) doesn&#x2019;t. Nor does 4002064 (four million two thousand sixty four).<br>It turns out that 6030 is the 64th positive integer that does not use an &#x201C;E&#x201D; when spelled out and<br>4002064 is the 838th such number. Your job is to find the n-th such number.<br>Note: 1,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,001,000 is &#x201C;one octillion, one septillion, one sextillion, one quintil-lion, one quadrillion, one trillion, one billion, one million, one thousand&#x201D;.
