He&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s brought L indistinguishable loads of laundry to his local laundromat, which has N washing machines and M dryers.The $i^{th}$ washing machine takes $W_i$ minutes to wash one load of laundry, and the $i^{th}$ dryer takes Di minutes to dry a load of laundry.<br>At any point in time, each machine may only be processing at most one load of laundry.<br>As one might expect, Panda wants to wash and then dry each of his L loads of laundry. Each load of laundry will go through the following steps in order:<br>1. A non-negative amount of time after Panda arrives at the laundromat, Panda places the load in an unoccupied washing machine i.<br>2. Wi minutes later, he removes the load from the washing machine, placing it in a temporary holding basket (which has unlimited space)<br>3. A non-negative amount of time later, he places the load in an unoccupied dryer j <br>4. Dj minutes later, he removes the load from the dryer Panda can instantaneously add laundry to or remove laundry from a machine.
