One day, Clarke split into two personality $a$ and $b$, they are playing a game.   <br>There is a $n*m$ matrix, each grid of this matrix has a number $c_{i, j}$.  <br>$a$ wants to beat $b$ every time, so $a$ ask you for a help.  <br>There are $q$ operations, each of them is belonging to one of the following two types:  <br>1. They play the game on a $(x_1, y_1)-(x_2, y_2)$ sub matrix. They take turns operating. On any turn, the player can choose a grid which has a positive integer from the sub matrix and decrease it by a positive integer which less than or equal this grid&apos;s number. The player who can&apos;t operate is loser. $a$ always operate first, he wants to know if he can win this game.  <br>2.
