Because he is angry, you will have to pay x yuan for every inversion in the sequence.<br>You don&apos;t want to pay too much, so you can try to play some tricks before he sees this sequence. You can pay y yuan to swap any two adjacent elements.<br>What is the minimum amount of money you need to spend?<br>The definition of inversion in this problem is pair $(i,j)$ which $1 \\leq i &lt; j \\leq n$ and $a_i &gt; a_j$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases, please read till the end of input file.<br>For each test, in the first line, three integers, n,x,y, n represents the length of the sequence.<br>In the second line, n integers separated by spaces, representing the orginal sequence a.<br>$1 \\leq n,x,y \\leq 100000$, numbers in the sequence are in $[-10^9,10^9]$.
