Many girls want to learn more about programming skills in ACM. As one of assistances of Lcy, Yifenfei is now busy preparing a new club called &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;MM Programming Club&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;. Of Course, He will be the leader of the club, and teach these girls patiently. After the news posted around the campus, as many as N girls are determined to take part in the club. However, the numbers of members are limited; Yifenfei will only select K of them. It is quite a difficult problem. Here is a list of all information about N girls. Each of them has intelligence value and prettiness value. He also wants these K members such that the difference of intelligence between any two of them must not be greater than MAXK (If K = 1, the difference is zero). Now he wants to maximize the Sum of these K girls&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; prettiness value.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Many test case, please process to end of file. Each test first contains three integers N(1 &lt;= N &lt;= 200), K(1 &lt;= K &lt;= N), MAXK(1 &lt;= MAXK &lt;= 500). Then N lines follow. Each line contains two integers S, T (1 &lt;= S, T &lt;= 500). S represents the intelligence value, and T represents the prettiness value.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"If he can&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t succeed in selecting K girls, print &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;-1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;.
