At second 0, Avin is at the location (0,0) on a number axis with a robot.<br>He wants to go to (L, 0) with the robot. He walks a unit distance per second, and he can only stop at integer coordinates. Now, he decides to follow these walking rules repeatedly until he arrives (L, 0) with the robot:<br>1) If Avin has the robot with himself, the robot may be dropped down with probability p.<br>2) If Avin had dropped the robot, he will figure it out with probability q. Specially, if Avin arrives at (L, 0) without robot, he will turn around immediately.<br>3) If Avin does not see that the robot had been dropped, he walks one step right; otherwise, he walks left until he is at the same location as the robot.<br>What is the expectation of walking time he needs to arrive (L, 0) with the robot?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"One line with three numbers L, p and q, where L (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; L &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 100, 000) is an integer, p and q are real numbers with three digits and within (0, 1).","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Print the expected walking time.
