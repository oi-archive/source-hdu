Users prefer simple passwords that are easy to remember (like buddy), but such passwords are often insecure. Some sites use random computer-generated passwords (like xvtpzyo), but users have a hard time remembering them and sometimes leave them written on notes stuck to their computer. One potential solution is to generate &quot;pronounceable&quot; passwords that are relatively secure but still easy to remember.<br><br>FnordCom is developing such a password generator. You work in the quality control department, and it&apos;s your job to test the generator and make sure that the passwords are acceptable. To be acceptable, a password must satisfy these three rules:<br><br>It must contain at least one vowel.<br><br>It cannot contain three consecutive vowels or three consecutive consonants.<br><br>It cannot contain two consecutive occurrences of the same letter, except for &apos;ee&apos; or &apos;oo&apos;.<br><br>(For the purposes of this problem, the vowels are &apos;a&apos;, &apos;e&apos;, &apos;i&apos;, &apos;o&apos;, and &apos;u&apos;; all other letters are consonants.) Note that these rules are not perfect; there are many common/pronounceable words that are not acceptable.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of one or more potential passwords, one per line, followed by a line containing only the word &apos;end&apos; that signals the end of the file.
