Execute an operation instruction according to a string of length $n$ from left to right that only contains $4$ different characters of $L$,$R$,$U$,$D$.<br><br>1. $L$ instruction means to fold it from left to right,<br><br>2. $R$ instruction means to fold from right to left, <br><br>3. $U$ instruction means to fold from top to bottom,<br><br>4. $D$ instruction means to fold in half from bottom to top. <br><br>Note that the operation is limited due to the limitation of the desktop. Namely, the fold operation is restricted. <b>For example, if you fold the paper from left to right, you should let the left side overlap on the right side with no rotation.</b><br><br>Now, cut a knife horizontally (completely cut) at the center of the visible part of the paper, and then cut vertically (completely cut).<br><br>The number of pieces of the whole paper split is $num(S)$.<br><br><b>See the example and the picture for better understanding.</b><br><br>Now given a nonnegative integer $n$, the string $S$ is generated from $4^n$ different possible outcomes in equal probability. Find the expected value of the number of pieces of the paper which is split, that is $E(num(S))$ mod $998244353$.<br><br>It can be shown that the answers can be represented by $\\frac{P}{Q}$, where $P$ and $Q$ are coprime integers, and  print the value of $P \\times Q^{-1} \\  mod $ $\\space 998244353$.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C883-1009-1.png\"></center>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer $ T $ ($1 \\le T \\le 10^5$), the number of testcases.<br><br>Each of the next $ T $ lines contains a number $ n $ ( $0 \\le  n  \\le  10^{18} $ ).<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each testcase, print the answer in one line.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n0\n1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4\n6</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2020+Multi-University+Training+Contest+5&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2020 Multi-University Training Contest 5 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
