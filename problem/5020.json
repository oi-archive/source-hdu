A set of points with this property is said to be collinear (often misspelled as colinear).<br>---Wikipedia<br><br>Today, Collinearity takes revenge on you. Given a set of N points in two-dimensional coordinate system, you have to find how many set of &lt;P<sub>i</sub>, P<sub>j</sub>, P<sub>k</sub>&gt; from these N points are collinear. Note that &lt;P<sub>i</sub>, P<sub>j</sub>, P<sub>k</sub>&gt; cannot contains same point, and &lt;P<sub>i</sub>, P<sub>j</sub>, P<sub>k</sub>&gt; and &lt;P<sub>i</sub>, P<sub>k</sub>, P<sub>j</sub>&gt; are considered as the same set, i.e. the order in the set doesn&#x2019;t matter.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer T, indicating the number of test cases. <br><br>Each test case begins with an integer N, following N lines, each line contains two integers Xi and Yi, describing a point.<br><br>[Technical Specification]<br>1. 1 &lt;= T &lt;= 33<br>2. 3 &lt;= N &lt;= 1 000<br>3. -1 000 000 000 &lt;= Xi, Yi &lt;= 1 000 000 000, and no two points are identical.<br>4.
