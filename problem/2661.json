Unfortunately, some displays always with one or more segment are broken, that means, the segment which should be light up when it display a digital can&apos;t work. For example, if the &apos;a&apos; segment is broken, then &apos;7&apos; and &apos;1&apos; will be displayed as &apos;1&apos; either. <br>Now, Bob who is standing on front of a broken LED display want to know, how many possible results would be the number on the display. For example, with a LED display which it&apos;s all &apos;a&apos; segments were broken, &quot;11&quot; would be 4 possible results which are &quot;11&quot;, &quot;17&quot;, &quot;71&quot; and &quot;77&quot;. Note that pre-zeros are valid, for example, &quot;0001&quot; is equal to &quot;1&quot; or &quot;01&quot;. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiply test cases, every case start with a single integers N in the first line, that is how many LED in this case, the second line is a string shows which segment is broken in the LED from &apos;a&apos; to &apos;g&apos;, good segment will replace as &apos;-&apos;, the follow N lines will hold a string in each line to show numbers from left to right, which shows the lighted segment in the i-th LED.
