You are to write a program which, given a string, determines the minimal number of characters to be inserted into the string in order to obtain a palindrome. <br><br>As an example, by inserting 2 characters, the string &quot;Ab3bd&quot; can be transformed into a palindrome (&quot;dAb3bAd&quot; or &quot;Adb3bdA&quot;). However, inserting fewer than 2 characters does not produce a palindrome. ","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Your program is to read from standard input.
