The country is consist of N cities. To capture the city i, it takes Ant A<sub>[i]</sub> minutes, and Bob needs B<sub>[i]</sub> minutes to capture city i. Due to the similarity of neighboring cities, If the city i and j are neighboring cities, if Ant has captured city i, then the time for Ant to capture city j is A<sub>[j]</sub>/2. Of course if Ant has captured city j, then the time for Ant to capture city i is A<sub>[i]</sub>/2. It is the same for Bob. We define the total time to capture a country be the time to capture city 1 + the time to capture city 2 + ... + the time to capture city N. Now we want to know the minimal total time.<br>For simplicity, we assume that there is only one path to go from one city to another city.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a integer N(0&lt;N&lt;100), which is the number of cities.Then following N lines describe A<sub>[1]</sub>, A<sub>[2]</sub>, &#x2026;, A<sub>[N]</sub>;Then following N lines describe B<sub>[1]</sub>, B<sub>[2]</sub>, &#x2026;, B<sub>[N]</sub>;Next comes N-1 lines, each contains two integers x, y, meaning that city x and city y are neighboring.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Just output the minimal total time in a single line.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n1 2 5\n3 8 1\n1 2\n1 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"HIT","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2012+Multi-University+Training+Contest+5&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2012 Multi-University Training Contest 5 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
