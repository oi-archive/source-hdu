The Zhongqiu Festival is held on the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese calendar, which is in September or early October in the Gregorian calendar. It is a date that parallels the autumnal equinox of the solar calendar, when the moon is at its fullest and roundest. <br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/4122-1.jpg\"></center> <br>The traditional food of this festival is the mooncake. Chinese family members and friends will gather to admire the bright mid-autumn harvest moon, and eat mooncakes under the moon together. In Chinese, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;round&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;(&#x532;) also means something like &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;faultless&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; or &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;reuion&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, so the roundest moon, and the round mooncakes make the Zhongqiu Festival a day of family reunion.<br><br>Alice has opened up a 24-hour mooncake shop. She always gets a lot of orders. Only when the time is K o&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;clock sharp( K = 0,1,2 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;. 23) she can make mooncakes, and We assume that making cakes takes no time. Due to the fluctuation of the price of the ingredients, the cost of a mooncake varies from hour to hour. She can make mooncakes when the order comes,or she can make mooncakes earlier than needed and store them in a fridge. The cost to store a mooncake for an hour is S and the storage life of a mooncake is T hours. She now asks you for help to work out a plan to minimize the cost to fulfill the orders.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains no more than 10 test cases. <br>For each test case:<br>The first line includes two integers N and M. N is the total number of orders. M is the number of hours the shop opens. <br>The next N lines describe all the orders.

H and R are all integers. <br>All the orders are sorted by the time in increasing order. <br>The next line contains T and S meaning that the storage life of a mooncake is T hours and the cost to store a mooncake for an hour is S.<br>Finally, M lines follow. Among those M lines, the i<sup>th</sup> line( i starts from 1) contains a integer indicating the cost to make a mooncake during the i<sup>th</sup> hour . The cost is no more than 10000.
