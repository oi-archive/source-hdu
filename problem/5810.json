In the experiment, he throws n balls into m boxes in such a manner that each ball has equal probability of going to each boxes. After the experiment, he calculated the statistical variance V as<br> $$V=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{m}(X_{i}-\\bar X)^{2}}{m}$$<br>where $X_{i}$  is the number of balls in the ith box, and  $\\bar X$ is the average number of balls in a box.<br>Your task is to find out the expected value of V.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains multiple test cases.
