There are N! permutations of a set which has N elements. For example, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1]. <br>But Bob think that some permutations are more beautiful than others. Bob write some pairs of integers(Ai, Bi) to distinguish beautiful permutations from ordinary ones. A permutation is considered beautiful if and only if for some i the Ai-th element of it is Bi. We want to know how many permutations of set {1, 2, ...., N} are beautiful.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer T indicating the number of test cases.<br>There are two integers N and M in the first line of each test case.
