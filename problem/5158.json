Now I have lost intersts in all of the foods. So when during the meal time, I don&#x2019;t know which mess I should go to. So I came up with a solution. <br>There are 4 messes in our school, I number them from 0 to 3. Then I says &#x201C;Big Bing Small Jiang, Point Who Is Who!&#x201D;, when I say the first word I point to the mess which is numbered 0, when I say the i-th (i&gt;1) word I point to the mess whose number is one larger than the previous one. In case of the number of previous mess is 3, I will point to 0 again. I will go to the mess which I point to last time. Thus in this case I will go to the mess which is numbered 3. The following table explains the course of my solution to this case.<br>$\\begin{array} {|c|c|c|c|}<br>\\hline<br> \\quad \\text{ Word I say} \\quad  &amp;\\quad \\text{ Big} \\quad  &amp;\\quad \\text{ Bing} \\quad  &amp;\\quad \\text{ Small} \\quad  &amp;\\quad \\text{ Jiang} \\quad  &amp;\\quad \\text{ Point} \\quad  &amp;\\quad \\text{ Who} \\quad  &amp;\\quad \\text{ Is} \\quad  &amp;\\quad \\text{ Who} \\quad\\\\<br>\\hline<br>\\hline<br> \\quad \\text{ Mess id I point to} \\quad  &amp;\\quad \\text{ 0} \\quad  &amp;\\quad \\text{ 1} \\quad  &amp;\\quad \\text{ 2} \\quad  &amp;\\quad \\text{ 3} \\quad  &amp;\\quad \\text{ 0} \\quad  &amp;\\quad \\text{ 1} \\quad  &amp;\\quad \\text{ 2} \\quad  &amp;\\quad \\text{ 3} \\quad\\\\<br>\\hline<br><br>\\end{array}\\\\<br>$<br>I will go to university after several days, I have heard that there are so many messes in it. So I will apply my solution again. Surpose there are n messes which are numberd through 0 to n-1, and I will say m words. When I say the first word I point to the mess which is numbered 0, when I say the i-th (i&gt;1) word  I point to the mess whose number is one larger than the previous one. In case of the number of previous mess is n-1, I will point to 0 again. I will go to the mess which I point to last time. So which mess will I point to?.<br>It is so time-consuming to count it through manual work. So I want you to write a program to help me.
