They like to find and solve interesting mathematic problems together. Now LMY designs a game for matrix. There is a large matrix whose rows and columns are both not more than 1000000000. And there are three operations for the matrix:<br>1) <i>add:</i> Mark an element in the matrix. It is guaranteed that the element has not been marked before.<br>2) <i>remove: </i>Delete an element&#x2019;s mark. It is guaranteed that the element has been marked before.<br>3) <i>find: </i>For a given element&#x2019;s row and column, return a marked element&#x2019;s row and column, where the marked element&#x2019;s row and column are larger than the given element&#x2019;s row and column respectively. If there are multiple solutions, return the element whose row is the smallest; and if there are still multiple solutions, return the element whose column is the smallest. If there is no solution, return -1.<br>LMY lets YY develop a program to solve the problem. Could you also develop a program to solve the problem?<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of multiple test cases.
