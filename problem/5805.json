After that, he calculated the maximum absolute value of the difference of each two adjacent remained numbers, denoted as $F$.<br><br>Now he wants to know the expected value of $F$, if he deleted each number with equal probability.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.<br><br>In each test case, the first line of the input contains an integer $n$, denoting the length of the original sequence.<br><br>The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$, denoting the elements of the sequence.<br><br>$1 \\le T \\le 10,~3 \\le n \\le 100000,~1 \\le A_i \\le 10^9$","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print a line with one integer, denoting the answer.<br><br>In order to prevent using float number, you should print the answer multiplied by $n$.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n4\n1 2 3 4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">6</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=BestCoder+Round+%2386&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> BestCoder Round #86 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
