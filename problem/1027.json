He opens the door and finds feng5166 is about to kill our pretty Princess.

So it&apos;s easy to see the second smallest sequence is 1,2,3...N,N-1. Now I will give you two numbers, N and M. You should tell me the Mth smallest sequence which is composed with number 1 to N. It&apos;s easy, isn&apos;t is?
