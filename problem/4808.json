He feels as if he is in an N-dimension Euclidean space, wandering aimlessly. In each step, he walks toward some direction and the &#x201C;length&#x201D; of each step will not exceed R. Technically speaking, Jenny is initially located at the origin of the N-dimension Euclidean space. Each step can be represented by a random N-dimension vector(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ... , x<sub>n</sub>) chosen uniformly from possible positions satisfying x<sub>i</sub> &gt;= 0 and x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>  + ...  &lt;= R<sup>2</sup>.<br>Assume the expectation of his coordinate after his first step is (y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, ... , y<sub>n</sub>). He wants to know the minimum y<sub>i</sub> .","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several (about 100,000) test cases, please process till EOF.<br>Each test case, only one line contains two integers N and R, representing the dimension of the space and the length limit of each step.(1 &lt;= n &lt;= 2  * 10<sup>5</sup>, R &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup>).","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print a real number representing the answer to the question above. <br>Your answer is considered correct if the difference between your answer and the correct one is less than 10<sup>-6</sup>.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">0.4244131816</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2013ACM%2FICPC%D1%C7%D6%DE%C7%F8%C4%CF%BE%A9%D5%BE%CF%D6%B3%A1%C8%FC%A1%AA%A1%AA%CC%E2%C4%BF%D6%D8%CF%D6&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2013ACM/ICPC&#x4E9A;&#x6D32;&#x533A;&#x5357;&#x4EAC;&#x7AD9;&#x73B0;&#x573A;&#x8D5B;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x9898;&#x76EE;&#x91CD;&#x73B0; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
