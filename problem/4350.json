He repeats this action again <br>and again for N times, and then he regards his cards as shuffled.<br><br>Given L,R and N, and the initial card stack, can you tell us what will the card stack be like after getting shuffled?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"First line contains an integer T(1 &lt;= T &lt;= 1000), which is the test cases.<br>For each test case, first line contains 52 numbers(all numbers are distinct and between 1 and 52), which is the card number of the stack, from top to bottom. <br>Then comes three numbers, they are N, L and R as described.
