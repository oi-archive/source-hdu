The weight of a subsequence T of S, denoted by weight(T), is defined as the sum of all its characters&#x2019; weights. Your task is to divide S into two subsequences T1 and T2, each of length N, such that:<br>   1.T1 is equal to T2.<br>   2.|weight(T1) &#x2013; weight(T2)| is as small as possible.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"   The input contains multiple test cases. <br>   Each case consists of three lines. <br><br>   The first line contains an integer N (1&lt;=N&lt;=20). <br>   The second line is a string S of length 2*N.
