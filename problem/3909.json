One day, he got some Sudoku problems and he wondered whether these problems are well designed. He needs your help now.<br><br>Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9 &#xD7; 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 &#xD7; 3 regions contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. <br>-- Wikipedia<br><br><br>In this problem, the grid has three different sizes, with the formal (N^2) &#xD7; (N^2), and N will be one in 2, 3 and 4. The rule is the same. The objective is to fill the (N^2) &#xD7; (N^2) grid with characters so that each column, each row, and each of the N^2 regions (each size is N &#xD7; N) contains all of the characters from 1 to 4(N = 2), 1 to 9(N = 3) or 1 to G (N = 4).<br><br>You task is that when you got a grid, you should tell the grid whether a puzzle or not. If it`s a puzzle, you should tell whether it is a minimal puzzle; else you should tell it has no solution or has multiple solutions.<br><br>A puzzle is a partially completed grid (the size is (N^2) &#xD7; (N^2), N = 2, 3, 4), and has one and only one solution. If remove any character from a puzzle, it will lead to multiple solutions, then it is called a minimal puzzle.<br><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several cases.
