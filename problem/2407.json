On one side of the wall, a girl ties N/2 knots between disjoint pairs of strands. On the other side of the wall, the girl&apos;s groom-to-be also ties N/2 knots between disjoint pairs of strands. You are to find the probability that the knotted strands form one big loop (in which case the couple will be allowed to marry). <br><br>For example, suppose that N = 4 and you number the strands 1, 2, 3, 4. Also suppose that the girl has created the following pairs of strands by tying knots: {(1, 4), (2,3)}. Then the groom-to-be has two choices for tying the knots on his side: {(1,2), {3,4)} or {(1,3), (2,4)}.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file consists of one or more lines.
