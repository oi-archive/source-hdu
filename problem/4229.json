Form four more, like this:<br><center>|a-b| |b-c| |c-d| |d-a|</center><br>That is, take the absolute value of the differences of a with b, b with c, c with d, and d with a. (Note that a zero could crop up, but they&#x2019;ll all still be non-negative.) Then, do it again with these four new numbers. And then again. And again. Eventually, all four integers will be the same. For example, start with 1,3,5,9:<br>1 3 5 9<br>2 2 4 8 (1)<br>0 2 4 6 (2)<br>2 2 2 6 (3)<br>0 0 4 4 (4)<br>0 4 0 4 (5)<br>4 4 4 4 (6)<br>In this case, the sequence converged in 6 steps. It turns out that in all cases, the sequence converges very quickly. In fact, it can be shown that if all four integers are less than 2^n, then it will take no more than 3*n steps to converge!<br>Given a, b, c and d, figure out just how quickly the sequence converges.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There will be several test cases in the input.
