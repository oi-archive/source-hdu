And you just have to tell me the ultimate area if there are a few rectangles.<br>Isn&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t it a piece of cake for you? Come on!

There are four integers, such as &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;(x1,y1,x2,y2)&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, describing the coordinates of the rectangle, with two brackets distinguishing other rectangle(s) from the string. There lies a plus symbol between every two rectangles. Blanks separating the integers and the interpunctions are added into the strings arbitrarily.
