You can do some round operations, where the initial round is numbered as the $1$-st round.<br><br>The operation of the $i$-th round is to modify the pile of stones numbered $(i - 1) \\bmod k$. In each round, you should remove from this pile some stones (at least one stone), satisfying that the number of stones in this pile before this operation is a multiple of the number of stones in this pile after operation, which means that you ought to remain at least one stone in this pile.<br><br>The game is ended if there exists at least one pile containing only one stone. Given two positive integers $n$ and $k$, your task is to calculate for each pile the number of the possible operation plans that it is the last operated pile before the game is ended.<br><br>The integer $n$ may be very large, so the prime-factor decomposition of $n$ will be given, in other words, if $n = \\prod_{i = 1}^{m}{p_i^{e_i}}$, then the integers $m$ and $(p_i, e_i)$ $(1 \\leq i \\leq m)$ will be given, but the integer $n$ will not.<br><br>The answer may be very large, so you only need to give the value of the answer modulo $985661441$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains multiple test cases.<br><br>For each test case:<br><br>The first line contains two positive integers $m$ and $k$, satisfying that $1 \\leq m, k \\leq 10$.<br><br>In next $m$ lines, the $i$-th line contains two positive integers $p_i$ and $e_i$, satisfying that $2 \\leq p_i \\leq 10^9,$ $e_i \\geq 1,$ $\\sum_{i = 1}^{m}{e_i} \\leq 10^5$.<br><br>It is guaranteed that $p_1, p_2, \\cdots, p_m$ are distinct.<br><br>About $200$ test cases in total, where no more than $5$ cases satisfy $\\sum_{i = 1}^{m}{e_i} \\geq 10^4$.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output &quot;<b>Case #$x$: $y_0$ $y_1$ $\\cdots$ $y_{k - 1}$</b>&quot; in one line (without quotes), where $x$ indicates the case number starting from $1$ and $y_i$ $(0 \\leq i &lt; k)$ denotes the number of the possible operation plans modulo $985661441$ for the pile numbered $i$ of corresponding case.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1 1\n2 2\n2 1\n3 1\n5 1\n1 2\n2 3\n2 2\n2 4\n5 4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 2\nCase #2: 3\nCase #3: 6 4\nCase #4: 1499980 1281085</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2017+Multi-University+Training+Contest+-+Team+1&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2017 Multi-University Training Contest - Team 1 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
