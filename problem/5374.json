Each type of piece do the same while receiving &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot; and &quot;down&quot; operation. specificly:  <br>Left: the entire piece moves left one square with the special square.  <br>Right: the entire piece moves right one square with the special square.  <br>Down: the entire piece moves down one square with the special square.  <br>Up: rotate 90 degree clockwise  <br>The original direction of each square will be same as the first pattern in each picture.  <br>More details see the following pictures  <br>and following is the detail about the &quot;up&quot; operatrion, notice the green square is the special square:  <br>1.

However, he find score record is omitted. So he ask you to finish it.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Multiple testcase.
