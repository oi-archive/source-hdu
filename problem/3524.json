There are many beautiful theorems about perfect squares in mathematics. Among which, Pythagoras Theorem is the most famous. It says that if the length of three sides of a right triangle is a, b and c respectively(a &lt; b &lt;c), then a^2 + b^2=c^2. <br>In this problem, we also propose an interesting question about perfect squares. For a given n, we want you to calculate the number of different perfect squares mod 2^n. We call such number f(n) for brevity. For example, when n=2, the sequence of {i^2 mod 2^n} is 0, 1, 0, 1, 0&#x2026;&#x2026;, so f(2)=2. Since f(n) may be quite large, you only need to output f(n) mod 10007.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a number T&lt;=200, which indicates the number of test case.<br>Then it follows T lines, each line is a positive number n(0&lt;n&lt;2*10^9).<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one line containing &quot;Case #x: y&quot;, where x is the case number (starting from 1) and y is f(x).","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n1\n2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 2\nCase #2: 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2010+ACM-ICPC+Multi-University+Training+Contest%A3%A89%A3%A9%A1%AA%A1%AAHost+by+HNU&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2010 ACM-ICPC Multi-University Training Contest&#xFF08;9&#xFF09;&#x2014;&#x2014;Host by HNU </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
