But if we make up a BST(binary search tree) before, then for each access, you need to spend log(N) time to do it. And for each access, there exists a road from the root node to the target node, whose length Ci is the number of the edges of the road. <br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Because there is an accessing frequency Fi for each key. And the total value of the tree is defined as following rule: SUM=Sigma(Ci*Fi), for i from 0 to N-1, N is the number of the keys. You need to find the minimal value M_SUM to make up a tree.<br><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/C125_1001_1.JPG\"><br><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/C125_1001_2.JPG\"><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"&#xA0;&#xA0;There are a lot of cases.
