One of his favourites is the following:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Xerier, his classmate, has made many cards. She writes down a single positive number on each of them. No numbers written on different cards are the same. After that she writes down an equation, whose right side is a single positive number chosen by her, and the left side is the sum of p integers:<br><br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Then she asks Xavier put p cards on the corresponding Xi&#x2019;s position to make this equation correct, with an additional condition that Xi should be ordered from smaller to bigger, i.e.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Every time Xavier immediately comes up with many solutions. Now he wants to know how many solutions in total are there for any n given by Xerier.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"&#xA0;&#xA0;There are multiple test cases. The number of them is given in the beginning of the input. Then a series of input block comes one by one.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;For each test case:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;The first line contains two space-separated integers m and p (1&lt;=p&lt;=5).  The second line contains m distinct positive integers - the numbers written on each of the cards. None of these integers exceeds 13000.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;There are about 120 test cases in total, but 90% of them are relatively small.
