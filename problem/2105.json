One day, Newton walked <br>leisurely, suddenly, an apple hit his head. Then Newton discovered the Universal Gravitation.From then<br>on,people have sovled many problems by the the theory of the Universal Gravitation. What&apos;s more, wo also<br>have known every object has its Center of Gravity.<br>Now,you have been given the coordinates of three points of a triangle. Can you calculate the center <br>of gravity of the triangle?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is an integer n,which is the number of test cases.<br>Then n lines follow.
