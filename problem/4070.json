In this game, we want infect all cells by the transmission and breed of phages.  <br>Originally, there is a cell infected by phages and this cell can breed a new phage every second. You should know that only the new born phages can inject other cells.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C348-1010-1.jpg.jpg\"></center><br>There are n cells around this cell, numbered from 1 to n. If there are Di phages reaching the i-th cell, the cell would be infected, and the phages journey will cost Ti seconds. To simplify it, we assume these phages will stay in this new cell and they can&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t infect other cells. And the new cell cannot breed new phages and infect other cells.<br>Can you tell me how much time it costs to infect all cells at least? <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"In the first line there is an integer T (T &lt;= 50), indicates the number of test cases.<br>In each case, the first line contains a integers N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^5).
