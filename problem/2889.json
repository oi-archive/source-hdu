So counting begins with 1, the first &quot;counting number&quot;, and continues: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12&#x2026;, 19, 21&#x2026;, 98, 99, 111, 112&#x2026;<br>So, in this system 9 is the ninth counting number and 11 is the tenth counting number. As usual, addition can be defined by reference to the counting sequence. Addition of the i-th counting number and the j-th counting number is defined to mean the (i+j)-th counting number. Thus, in this system 5 + 8 = 14, since 5 is the fifth counting number, 8 is the eighth, and 14 is the thirteenth counting number. Subtraction is the reverse of addition.<br>Here is your task, given two numbers: a and b, you should output a subtract b which is defined in no-zero number system.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Multiple test cases, each line contains two positive integers: a and b, 1 &lt;= b &lt; a &lt; 1000000000, it is guaranteed that both a and b will not contain digit 0.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"One line for each case, the result of a subtract b which is defined in no-zero number system.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">14 5\n111 99\n191 111</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">8\n1\n79</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2009+Multi-University+Training+Contest+9+-+Host+by+HIT&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2009 Multi-University Training Contest 9 - Host by HIT </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
