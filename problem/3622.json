The game field is an unbounded 2-dimensional region. There are N rounds in the game. At each round, the computer will give Robbie two places, and Robbie should choose one of them to put a bomb. The explosion area of the bomb is a circle whose center is just the chosen place. Robbie can control the power of the bomb, that is, he can control the radius of each circle. A strange requirement is that there should be no common area for any two circles. The final score is the minimum radius of all the N circles.<br>Robbie has cracked the game, and he has known all the candidate places of each round before the game starts. Now he wants to know the maximum score he can get with the optimal strategy.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of each test case is an integer N (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 100), indicating the number of rounds.
