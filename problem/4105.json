He needs the height of each peak value and valley value for further study (a peak value means the value is strictly larger than its neighbors and a valley value means the value is strictly smaller than its neighbors). He did write these numbers down but he was too careless that he wrote them in a line without separations, such as &#x201C;712495&#x201D; may represent &#x201C;7 12 4 9 5&#x201D;. The only information he can remember was:<br>1. The data begins with a valley value<br>2. Each value is either a peak value or a valley value<br>Now he wants to insert blanks to make the data valid. If multiple solutions exist, he will choose the one with more blanks.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists several testcases.<br>The first line contains one integer N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100), the length of the data.<br>The second line contains one string S, the data he recorded.<br>S contains only digits.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Print one integer, the maximum number of blanks he can insert.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">6\n712495</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nThe separated data may have leading zeros.\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2011+Alibaba-Cup+Campus+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2011 Alibaba-Cup Campus Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
