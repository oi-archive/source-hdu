The $i_th$ workstation needs exactly (no more and no less) $W_i$ memory capacity to work.<br>Each workstation can use unlimited amount of memory banks, Total memory capacity of this workstation is the sum of capacity of all memory banks it used.<br>We need to make all workstations work and calculate the total capacity of unused memory banks, can you help us?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:<br>$X_0$ ... $X_{59}$<br>n<br>$W_1$ ... $W_n$<br><b>Constraints</b><br>0 &#x2264; $X_i$ &#x2264; 2^60<br>1 &#x2264; n &#x2264; 100000<br>0 &#x2264; $W_i$ &#x2264; 2^60<br>All of them are integers.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"Print one line denotes the answer.<br>If it is possible to make all workstations work, output a single number represents the total capacity of unused memory banks.
