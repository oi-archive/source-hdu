There are $n$ pets standing in a row, and the $i$-th of them has $m_i$ kinds of magic, the $j$-th magic can be described as a pair of non-negative integers$(x_{ij},y_{ij})$. If she use this magic to a non-negative integer $w$, then she can turn $w$ into $w\\oplus x_{ij}$ or $w\\oplus y_{ij}$  as she wants. addtionally, the $i$-th pet has her favorate integer $p_i$.<br><br>Satori&apos;s game consists of $q$ rounds. In each round, one of following two things may happan:<br><br>1. Koishi closes her third eye, so Satori select one of her pets, and change its favorate integer.<br><br>2. Koishi&apos;s third eye reopens, so Satori tells three non-negative integers $l,r,x(1\\leq l\\leq r\\leq n)$. Then, pets with index from $l$ to $r$ will use the magic to the integer $x$ one by one($l$-th is the first and $r$-th is the last), every pet \\textbf{must}  use \\textbf{each} of her magic \\textbf{exactly once}. After $r$-th pet finishes her operation, integer $x$ will become $y$ at last. Every pet want the final $y$ to be her own favorate integer $p$. so the $i$-th pet will try her best to make $y\\oplus p_i$ as small as possible(notice $y$ is the final integer) . Every pet konws any other pets&apos; magic details, favorate integer, and $l,r,x$ in the current round. Suppose they are all the cleverest, what&apos;s the final integer $y$?<br><br>Koishi is NO.1 all over the world, so she computes the final $y$ easily.<br><br>What about you?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains one positive integer $T(1\\leq T\\leq 15)$, representing $T$ test cases.<br><br>In each test case, the first line contains two positive integer $n,q(1\\leq n,q\\leq 10^5)$, number of pets and rounds.<br><br>Following is information of pets.
