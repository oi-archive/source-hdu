The object consists of two orthogonal cylinders. The two cylinders intersect each other in the middle place. One example is shown in Fig. 1. The radiuses of the bottom disk of both cylinders are R, and the heights of both cylinders are H.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C311-1009-1.jpg\"></center>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"We test the problem in many cases.
