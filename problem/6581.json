They are now driving on a one-way road and several cars are in front of them. To be more specific, there are $n$ cars in front of them. The $i$th car has a length of $l_{i}$, the head of it is $s_{i}$ from the stop-line, and its maximum velocity is $v_{i}$. The car Tom and Jerry are driving is $l_{0}$ in length, and $s_{0}$ from the stop-line, with a maximum velocity of $v_{0}$.<br>The traffic light has a very long cycle. You can assume that it is always green light. However, since the road is too narrow, no car can get ahead of other cars. Even if your speed can be greater than the car in front of you, you still can only drive at the same speed as the anterior car. But when not affected by the car ahead, the driver will drive at the maximum speed. You can assume that every driver here is very good at driving, so that the distance of adjacent cars can be kept to be $0$.<br>Though Tom and Jerry know that they can pass the stop-line during green light, they still want to know the minimum time they need to pass the stop-line. We say a car passes the stop-line once the head of the car passes it.<br>Please notice that even after a car passes the stop-line, it still runs on the road, and cannot be overtaken.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"This problem contains multiple test cases.<br>For each test case, the first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10 ^ 5, \\sum n \\leq 2 \\times 10 ^ 6$), the number of cars.<br>The next three lines each contains $n + 1$ integers, $l_{i},s_{i},v_{i}$ ($1 \\leq s_{i},v_{i},l_{i} \\leq 10 ^ 9$).
