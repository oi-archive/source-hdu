For example, any even number has the property that could be divided by 2.&quot;,daizhenyang got confused,for he don&apos;t have the concept of divisibility.He asks other people for help,first,he randomizely writes some positive integer numbers,then you have to pick some numbers from the group,the only constraint is that if you choose number a,you can&apos;t choose a number divides a or a number divided by a.(to illustrate the concept of divisibility),and you have to choose as many numbers as you can.<br>Poor daizhenyang does well in neither math nor programming.The responsibility comes to you!","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"An integer t,indicating the number of testcases,<br>For every case, first a number n indicating daizhenyang has writen n numbers(n&lt;=1000),then n numbers,all in the range of (1...2^63-1).<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"The most number you can choose.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n3\n1 2 3 </div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n\n\nHint:\nIf we choose 2 and 3,one is not divisible by the other,which is the most number you can choose.</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"DaiZhenyang@BUPT","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=HDOJ+Monthly+Contest+%A8C+2010.03.06&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> HDOJ Monthly Contest &#xFFFD;C 2010.03.06 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
