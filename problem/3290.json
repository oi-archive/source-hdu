Each notes has its label. It is labeled from 1.On the first day,only each leaf nodes(has no children nodes) have apples. Any other nodes have no apples. The number of apples that each leaf nodes have is just the label of this node.When all the immediate children of a node each has apples,this node will grow some apple on the next day. If a node has K immediate children node,the number of apple that this node grow on next day is just the number of apples that the (K + 1) / 2th smaller node has.The Xth smaller node means there are X &#x2013; 1 nodes&#x2019; number of apples is less than this node&#x2019;s number of apple.<br>Now you task is to calculate the number of apples that the root has at last.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.<br>Each case contains a positive integer N, it means this tree has N nodes, labeled 1, 2, ...

The (X + 1)th line in each test case starts with a number p (0 &lt;= p &lt;N), it means the Xth node has p immediate children nodes.then followed by p positive integer, means the label of immediate child node","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"Print the number of apples that the root grow at last.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">7\n2 2 3\n2 5 4\n2 6 7\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n12\n3 2 3 4\n0\n2 5 6\n3 7 8 9\n3 10 11 12\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4\n6</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Author","content":"B.A.C","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2010+%A1%B0HDU-Sailormoon%A1%B1+Programming+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2010 &#x201C;HDU-Sailormoon&#x201D; Programming Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
