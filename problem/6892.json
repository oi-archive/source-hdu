Today&apos;s menu is chocolate!<br><br>Though every baby likes chocolate, the appetites of babies are little. After lunch, there are still $n$ pieces of chocolate remained: The length of the $i$th piece is $l_i$.<br><br>Using the remained chocolate, Baby Volcano is going to play a game with his teacher, Mr. Sprague. The rule of the game is quite simple.<br><br>Two player plays in turns, and Baby Volcano will play first:<br><br>1. In each turn, the player needs to select one piece of chocolate. If the length of the selected piece is equal to $1$, the player of this turn will lose immediately.<br>2. Suppose the length of the selected piece is $l$. Then the player needs to select a positive integer $k$ satisfying $k$ is at least $2$ and $k$ is a factor of $l$.<br>3. Then the player needs to cut the selected piece into $k$ pieces with length $\\frac{l}{k}$.<br><br>The game continues until one player selects a piece of chocolate with length $1$.<br><br>Suppose both players plays optimally, your task is to determine whether Baby Volcano will win.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains single integer $t (1 \\leq t \\leq 2 * 10^4)$, the number of testcases.<br><br>For each testcase, the first line contains a single integer $n (1 \\leq n \\leq 10)$.<br><br>The second line contains $n$ positive integers $l_i (1 \\leq l_i \\leq 10^9)$, representing the length of each piece.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each testcase, output char &apos;W&apos; if Baby Volcano will win, otherwise output char &apos;L&apos;.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n2\n4 9\n2\n2 3\n3\n3 9 27</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">W\nL\nL</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2020%D6%D0%B9%FA%B4%F3%D1%A7%C9%FA%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%BE%BA%C8%FC%A3%A8CCPC%A3%A9+-+%CD%F8%C2%E7%D1%A1%B0%CE%C8%FC&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2020&#xFFFD;&#x439;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x467;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x1BE;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;CCPC&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; - &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x461;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
