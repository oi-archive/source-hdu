The kingdom consists of two cities and N &lt; 150 towns, with nonintersecting roads between some of them. The roads are bidirectional, and it takes the same amount of time to travel them in both directions. Kong has G &lt; 353535 soldiers. <br>Due to increased smuggling of goat cheese between the two cities, Kong has to place his soldiers on some of the roads in such a way that it is impossible to go from one city to the other without passing a soldier. The soldiers must not be placed inside a town, but may be placed on a road, as close as Kong wishes, to any town. Any number of soldiers may be placed on the same road. However, should any of the two cities be attacked by a foreign army, the king must be able to move all his soldiers fast to the attacked city. Help him place the soldiers in such a way that this mobilizing time is minimized. <br>Note that the soldiers cannot be placed in any of the cities or towns. The cities have ZIP-codes 95050 and 104729, whereas the towns have ZIPcodes from 0 to N - 1. There will be at most one road between any given pair of towns or cities.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case is N, G and E, where N and G are as defined above and E &lt; 5000 is the number of roads. Then follow E lines, each of which contains three integers: A and B, the ZIP codes of the endpoints, and &#x3C6;, the time required to travel the road,&#x3C6; &lt; 1000. The last line of the input is a line containing a single 0.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case in the input, print the best mobilizing time possible, with one decimal.
