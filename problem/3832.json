Each street light can be viewed as a point in a plane, which casts flash in a circular area with certain radius.<br>What&apos;s more, if two illuminated circles share one intersection or a point, they can be regarded as connected.<br>Now the manager wants to turn off as many lights as possible, guaranteeing that the illuminated area of the library, the study room and the dormitory are still connected(directly or indirectly). So, at least the lights in these three places will not be turned off.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer T, which tells you there are T cases followed.<br>In each case:<br>The first line is an integer N( 3&lt;=N&lt;=200 ), means there are N street lights at total.<br>Then there are N lines: each line contain 3 integers, X,Y,R,( 1&lt;=X,Y,R&lt;=1000 ), means the light in position(X,Y) can illuminate a circle area with the radius of R.
