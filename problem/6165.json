Suddenly, LSH, Boss of FFF Group caught both of them, and locked them into two separate cells of the jail randomly. But as the saying goes: There is always a way out , the lovers made a bet with LSH: if either of them can reach the cell of the other one, then LSH has to let them go.<br>The jail is formed of several cells and each cell has some special portals connect to a specific cell. One can be transported to the connected cell by the portal, but be transported back is impossible. There will not be a portal connecting a cell and itself, and since the cost of a portal is pretty expensive, LSH would not tolerate the fact that two portals connect exactly the same two cells.<br>As an enthusiastic person of the FFF group, YOU are quit curious about whether the lovers can survive or not. So you get a map of the jail and decide to figure it out.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"$\\bullet$Input starts with an integer T (T&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;120), denoting the number of test cases.<br>$\\bullet$For each case,<br>First line is two number n and m, the total number of cells and portals in the jail.(2&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;n&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;1000,m&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;6000)<br>Then next m lines each contains two integer u and v, which indicates a portal from u to v.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"If the couple can survive, print &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;I love you my love and our love save us!&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<br>Otherwise, print &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Light my fire!&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n5 5\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n3 5\n4 5\n\n3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n\n5 5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n3 4\n4 5</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Light my fire!\nI love you my love and our love save us!\nI love you my love and our love save us!</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2017+Multi-University+Training+Contest+-+Team+9&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2017 Multi-University Training Contest - Team 9 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
