However my bicycle has been stolen, which means I have to take buses. Let&apos;s consider the bus-net as a diagram. Vertices of the diagram (numbered 1, 2,..., N), correspond to stations, edges &lt;pi, pj&gt;(pi != pj), denote that there is a direct connections from the station pi to the station pj (1&lt;= pi, pj &lt;= N). Transportation lines are numbered 1, 2,..., K. The L-th transportation line is defined as a series of stations p<sub>L,1</sub>, p<sub>L,2</sub>,..., p<sub>L,sL</sub>, on which vehicles of the L-th line stop, and durations r<sub>L,1</sub>, r<sub>L,2</sub>,...,r<sub>L,sL-1</sub> of traveling between stations--- r<sub>L,1</sub> is the time necessary to get from the station p<sub>L,1</sub> to the station p<sub>L,2</sub>, or vice versa (i.e. from the station p<sub>L,2</sub> to the station p<sub>L,1</sub>); r<sub>L,2</sub> is the time necessary to get from the station p<sub>L,2</sub> to p<sub>L,3</sub>, etc. All the stations of a line are different (i.e. i != j, implies p<sub>L,i</sub> != p<sub>L,j</sub>). In the L-th transportation line, buses run with certain frequency c<sub>L</sub>, and c<sub>L</sub> is a number from the set {6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60}. The buses in the L-th transportation line, start from the station p<sub>L,1</sub>  at each hour of the day and night, g:0, (0&lt;= g &lt;=23), and then according to the frequency of the line i.e. at g:cL, g:2cL,... etc. (g:c<sub>L</sub> means c<sub>L</sub> minutes after hour g). Buses of the L-th line run in two directions: from the station p<sub>L,1</sub> to p<sub>L,sL</sub>, and from the station p<sub>L,sL</sub> to p<sub>L,1</sub>. The hours of departure of the buses of the L-th transportation line from the station p<sub>L,sL</sub> are the same as from the station p<sub>L,1</sub>. In such a bus-net, we want to have a trip from the start station X which is near my school to the finish station Y which is near my home. During the trip one can change transportation lines, if he/she wants to. Say, the time of a change is equal to 0, however, while changing the line we have to take under consideration the time of waiting for the bus that we want to get into. Because of my poor memory, I can only change the line in no more than T (1&lt;= T &lt;= 20) times. And your task is to find a way from the start station X, to the finish station Y in W (0&lt;= W &lt;= 1440) minutes and change the lines as few as possible, if there are many ways to go back home and change the same least times of bus, choose the quickest one.<br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"In the first line there are written 8 integers, separated by single spaces:<br>N (1&lt;= N &lt;=200, number of stations), K (1&lt;= K &lt;=300, number of lines), X (1&lt;= X &lt;=N, the start station), Y (1&lt;= Y &lt;=N, X != Y, the finish station), GX (0&lt;= GX &lt;=23, the hour of the beginning of the trip), MX (0 &lt;= MX &lt;= 59, the minute of the beginning of the trip), W (0&lt;= W &lt;= 1440, the minute you must go back home within), T (1&lt;= T &lt;= 20, the times of changing line).<br><br>The stations are numbered from 1 to N, the transportation lines from 1 to K.
