Then one of the points is chosen (as the first pivot) and a line is drawn through the chosen point at some initial angle.  The animation proceeds by rotating the line counter-clockwise about the pivot at a constant rate.    When the line hits another of the points, that point becomes the new pivot point.  In the two examples below, the points are (-1,1), (1,1), (0,0),  (-1,-2) and (1,-2).<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C426-1008-1.jpg\"></center> <br><center><b> Example 1</b></center><br><br>In Example 1, the start point is point 1 and the line starts rotated 45 degrees from horizontal.  When the line rotates to 90 degrees, point 4 is hit and becomes the new pivot.  Then point 5 becomes the new pivot, then point 2 then point 1.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C426-1008-2.jpg\"></center> <br><center><b> Example 2</b></center><br><br>In Example 2, the initial point is point 3 and the line starts horizontal.  At 45 degrees, point 2 becomes the pivot, then at about 56 degrees, point 4 becomes the pivot. At about 63 degrees, point 3 becomes the pivot again, then point 5, point 1 and back  to 3 as at the start.<br><br> Write a program, which takes as input the points of the set, the initial point and the initial line angle and outputs the sequence of pivot points.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a single integer P, (1&lt;=  P &lt;= 1000), which is the number of data sets that follow.

The first line of each data set consists of four space- separated decimal integers followed by a single floating-point value.  The first integer is the data set number. The second integer is the number of points M to follow (3  &lt;=  M  &lt;=  20).  The third integer gives the number, s , of the pivot points to output (3  &lt;=   s   &lt;=  20) and the fourth integer gives the index, I, of the initial point (1  &lt;=  I &lt;=  M).  The floating-point value is the angle, A, in degrees, that the initial line is rotated counter-clockwise from horizontal (0  &lt;=  A  &lt;  180).<br><br>The remaining M lines in the data set contain the coordinates of the set of points.
