Yuta is worrying about this situation, so he gives Rikka some math tasks to practice. There is one of them:<br><br>Correct parentheses sequences can be defined recursively as follows:<br>1.The empty string &quot;&quot; is a correct sequence.<br> 2.If &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are correct sequences, then &quot;XY&quot; (the concatenation of X and Y) is a correct sequence.<br>   3.If &quot;X&quot; is a correct sequence, then &quot;(X)&quot; is a correct sequence.<br>Each correct parentheses sequence can be derived using the above rules.<br>Examples of correct parentheses sequences include &quot;&quot;, &quot;()&quot;, &quot;()()()&quot;, &quot;(()())&quot;, and &quot;(((())))&quot;.<br><br>For a parentheses sequence, Rikka can make some operations on it. Each time she can choose two indices L and R such that L &lt;= R. The operation modifies the characters on indices from L to R, inclusive. First, the order of these characters is reversed. Then, each character is toggled to the opposite one. That is, each &apos;(&apos; in the specified range changes to a &apos;)&apos; and vice versa.<br><br>The value of a parentheses sequence is the minimal number of the operations to change it to a correct parentheses sequence. If it is impossible, the value of the sequence is equal to 10^100.<br><br>For example, The value of &apos;()((&apos; is 1, the value of &apos;()()&apos; is 0 and the value of &apos;(((&apos; is 10^100.<br><br>Now Yuta shows two numbers n and m, For each K in [0,n], he wants to know the number of the different parentheses sequence of length n which has value K. The answer may be very large, he only wants to know the answer module m.<br><br>It is too difficult for Rikka. Can you help her?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a number t(1&lt;=t&lt;=10), the number of the testcases.
