Large number of players put themselves in it day after days&#x2026;<br><br>JinYueTuan is a simple game with these rules:<br>Only seven keys on the keyboard will be used in games, each key are assigned to one of the seven sound tracks. During the game, a series of notes may fall in each sound track irregularly. When notes fall down in one sound track, player should press the assigned key at once. If so, then got a &#x201C;Cool&#x201D;, or get &#x201C;Miss&#x201D; otherwise.<br><br>There are two types of &#x201C;Note&#x201D;: &#x201C;single note&#x201D; and &#x201C;strip note&#x201D;. Just as the name implies, &#x201C;single note&#x201D; means a single note, press right key at the right time once, then you can get a &#x201C;Cool&#x201D;, otherwise &#x201C;Miss&#x201D;; &#x201C;strip note&#x201D; needs you keeping press the corresponding key from the start time to the end time of the note. Press key at the begin time you may get a &#x201C;Cool&#x201D;, and release at the end time to get another &#x201C;Cool&#x201D;, you will &#x201C;Miss&#x201D; either early or late. If &#x201C;Miss&#x201D; at the begin time, then &#x201C;Miss&#x201D; the other (the end time) immediately.<br><br>People lament about the fact that such an easy game is limited by the hardware design, the so-called &#x201C;keys confliction&#x201D;. &#x201C;keys confliction&#x201D; means some key combinations cannot be pressed. For example, when Track 1,4,5,6 fall a note at the same time respectively, we should press the four keys at the same time, but now, keys confliction may happen, and cause this to fail, then you will &#x201C;Miss&#x201D; all these four notes. Keys confliction meets the relation of inclusion, in other words, if keys set S would cause the confliction, so would keys set T when S is included in T. Note that, if at a certain moment in time, some keys should be pressed and some pressing keys should be released, then you can release and press at the same time, and released keys won&#x2019;t cause any keys confliction at all.<br><br>Because of the keys confliction, we have to give up some notes to save as more other notes as possible. More details will be explained in the sample data.<br><br>Now you know the falling time and type (single or strip) of each note in each sound track, and all keys-assembling that may cause confliction. Your task is to calculate the maximum number of &#x201C;Cool&#x201D; that player can get.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases, the number of them T is given in the very first line, followed by T cases.<br><br>For each test case:<br>First line contains an integer N, the length of the music (1&#x2264;N&#x2264;1000).<br>The next 7 lines will contain description of each sound track.
