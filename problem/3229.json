Large number of players put themselves in it day after days&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<br><br>JinYueTuan is a simple game with these rules:<br>Only seven keys on the keyboard will be used in games, each key are assigned to one of the seven sound tracks. During the game, a series of notes may fall in each sound track irregularly. When notes fall down in one sound track, player should press the assigned key at once. If so, then got a &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Cool&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, or get &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Miss&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; otherwise.<br><br>There are two types of &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Note&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;: &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;single note&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; and &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;strip note&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;. Just as the name implies, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;single note&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; means a single note, press right key at the right time once, then you can get a &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Cool&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, otherwise &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Miss&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;; &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;strip note&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; needs you keeping press the corresponding key from the start time to the end time of the note. Press key at the begin time you may get a &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Cool&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, and release at the end time to get another &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Cool&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, you will &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Miss&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; either early or late. If &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Miss&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; at the begin time, then &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Miss&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; the other (the end time) immediately.<br><br>People lament about the fact that such an easy game is limited by the hardware design, the so-called &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;keys confliction&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;. &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;keys confliction&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; means some key combinations cannot be pressed. For example, when Track 1,4,5,6 fall a note at the same time respectively, we should press the four keys at the same time, but now, keys confliction may happen, and cause this to fail, then you will &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Miss&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; all these four notes. Keys confliction meets the relation of inclusion, in other words, if keys set S would cause the confliction, so would keys set T when S is included in T. Note that, if at a certain moment in time, some keys should be pressed and some pressing keys should be released, then you can release and press at the same time, and released keys won&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t cause any keys confliction at all.<br><br>Because of the keys confliction, we have to give up some notes to save as more other notes as possible. More details will be explained in the sample data.<br><br>Now you know the falling time and type (single or strip) of each note in each sound track, and all keys-assembling that may cause confliction. Your task is to calculate the maximum number of &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Cool&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; that player can get.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases, the number of them T is given in the very first line, followed by T cases.<br><br>For each test case:<br>First line contains an integer N, the length of the music (1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;N&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;1000).<br>The next 7 lines will contain description of each sound track.
