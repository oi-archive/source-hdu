That&#x2019;s very grand!<br>And now, ALPCs have received a arduous mission&#x2014;&#x2014;taking a parade at August first.<br>The traditional order is rectangular, but ALPCs want to make a innovation. They start to research a new triangular order called Yang Hui&#x2019;s triangle.<br>Yang Hui&#x2019;s triangle is known to all: <br>1<br>1  1<br>1  2  1<br>1  3  3  1<br>1  4  6  4  1<br>1  5  10  10  5  1<br>In it the ends of each line is 1, and every other number in each line equals to the sum of the two numbers on the shoulders. It&#x2019;s obvious that it&#x2019;s a piece of cake (especially with the help of computer)for us to get value of the C-th number in line R, therefore our problem goes to the opposite: given two Continuous numbers in a same line, please find out their positions in this huge triangle.<br> ","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input is a N indicating the test cases number. <br>Then follow N lines.
