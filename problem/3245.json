The length of road connecting every pair of adjacent towns is always 1 unit.<br><br>You want to hold an exhibition simultaneously on no more than L+1 consecutive towns, i.e. you choose two towns u and v of no more than L unit apart, and set up your exhibition in all the towns on the unique path from u to v. You want to attract people from all over the treeland to your exhibition, so you&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;d like to minimize the sum of &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;travelling distance&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; from every town. The &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;travelling distance&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; of a town is the distance from that town to its closest exhibition-town.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are at most 25 test cases. Each case begins with two integers, n and L (n &lt;= 10000, 0 &lt; L &lt;= 100), the number of towns, and the maximal distance of the &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;endpoint towns&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; you choose. Next n-1 lines contain the descriptions of connections, each with two integers a and b, indicating that town a and town b are directly connected (towns are numbered from 0 to n-1). The input ends with n = L = 0.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print the minimal sum of travelling distance.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3 1\n0 1\n1 2\n4 1\n0 1\n1 2\n2 3\n0 0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2009+%A1%B0NIT+Cup%A1%B1+National+Invitational+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2009 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;NIT Cup&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; National Invitational Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
