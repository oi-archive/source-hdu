Unfortunately, there were some wolves in the same forest. The rabbit kingdom was attacked by those wolves sometimes and they planned to defend against the wolves.<br><br>   For each wolves&apos; attack, the rabbit king would choose some rabbits(at least four rabbits) to make a defense team. We can regard each rabbit as a point in the three dimensional space. In the kingdom, there were no four rabbits stayed on a same plane.<br><br>   During each attack, the number of wolves which would be killed was exactly equal to the number of rabbits which are ON the 3D convex hull of the defense team.<br><br>   All defense teams should be different. But two different teams might share some rabbits. If the rabbit king couldn&apos;t choose a defense team any more, the rabbit kingdom would be destroyed.<br><br>   Now the wolves want to calculate the number of wolves which would be killed if they wanted to destroy the rabbit kingdom.
