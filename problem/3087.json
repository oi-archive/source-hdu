The way to play the game is simple:<br>Give you a n*n chessboard. At first there are some blisters(&#x6C34;&#x6CE1;) on some position of the chessboard. There are three kinds of blisters. They will contain 1, 2 or 3 globules(&#x6C34;&#x73E0;).<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/3087-1.jpg\"></center><br>Now ZWC can choose one grid which has a blister to click. When being clicked, the blister will add one globule. If the number of globules in one blister is not less than 4, the blister will burst and disappear. Meanwhile, it will splash into 4 globules to up, down, left, right direction. In each direction, the first blister that not burst will absorb the globule and its globules will add one. This action may cause new blisters&#x2019; burst. If all the blisters have burst, ZWC will win the game.<br><br>To simplify this problem, <b>you may suppose the globules move very fast and every second divide into two parts, at first all blisters have not less than 4 globules will burst and splash globules. Then the blisters still not burst try to absorb these globules. The following second repeats the same action.<br>You can get more detailed information from the sample.</b><br>ZWC wants to know whether he could win the game by clicking only one of the blisters. Can you help him?<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input is a single integer T which means the number of test cases.<br>Each test case starts with a line contains three numbers n (0 &lt; n &lt;= 20), the size of chessboard, x, y (1 &lt;= x, y &lt;= n) the grid that ZWC has clicked. Then n lines follow, each contains n integers. The integer a<sub>ij</sub> (0&lt;=a<sub>ij</sub> &lt;4) indicates the ith row and jth column of the chessboard has a blister with a<sub>ij</sub> globules, a<sub>ij</sub> = 0 means there isn&#x2019;t exist a blister.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each case, print the case number followed by the answer of your program.
