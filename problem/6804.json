Zhang3 organized a rope pulling contest between Class 1 and Class 2.<br><br>There are $n$ students in Class 1 and $m$ students in Class 2. The $i^\\mathrm{th}$ student has strength $w_i$ and beauty-value $v_i$. Zhang3 needs to choose some students from both classes, and let those chosen from Class 1 compete against those chosen from Class 2. It is also allowed to choose no students from a class or to choose all of them.<br><br>To be a fair contest, the total strength of both teams must be equal. To make the contest more beautiful, Zhang3 wants to choose such a set of students, that the total beauty-value of all participants is maximized. Please help her determine the optimal total beauty-value.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T \\; (1 \\le T \\le 30)$. $T$ test cases follow.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains two integers $n, m \\; (1 \\le n, m \\le 1000)$, representing the number of students in Class 1 and Class 2.<br><br>Then $(n + m)$ lines follow, describing the students.
