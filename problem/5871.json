Intuitively, cactus is a generalization of a tree where some cycles are allowed. Given an undirected graph $G(V,E)$, where $ V $ is the set of vertices and $ E $ of edges, where an edge is a set of two distinct vertices $ \\{v_1,v_2\\}\\subseteq V $. An $induced\\ subgraph$ of a graph is another graph, formed from a subset of the vertices of the graph and $all$ of the edges connecting pairs of vertices in that subset. Now, here comes the problem: How many induced subgraphs of a cactus are still cactuses?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several cases, process till end of input. <br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;For each case, the first line contains an integer $ N $, the second line an integer $ M $, denoting respectively the number of vertices and edges of the given directed graph.
