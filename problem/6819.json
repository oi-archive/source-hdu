Denote set $S=\\{i | i \\in [1,n]\\}$. Starting with Alice, take a number from $S$ in turn and put it at the end of a sequence $A$ with deleting it from $S$. Initially the sequence $A$ is empty. $P(A)$ indicates that $A$ contains an increasing subsequence of length $k$ at this time.<br><br>There are two versions of the game:<br><br><br>$\\qquad$Version $1$: Whoever makes the condition $P(A)$ satisfied for the first time wins.<br><br><br>$\\qquad$Version $2$: Whoever makes the condition $P(A)$ satisfied for the first time loses.<br><br><br><b>For the above two versions: whoever can&apos;t take out a number fails, i.e., $S$ is empty when it is his turn.</b><br><br>In fact, they have already taken $q$ numbers totally from the set $S$ and <b>none of them  have won</b>. <br><br>Now please tell Alice if she can win. If she can, tell her how many ways she can take in the next step.<br><br>You can assume that Alice and Bob are smart enough since the $q+1$-th operation.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ ($1\\le T\\le1000$), the number of test cases.<br><br><br>Each test case includes two lines:<br><br><br>The first line contains $4$ integers $n$, $v$, $q$, $k$ ( $3\\le n\\le10^{5}$ , $1\\le v\\le2$, $2\\le q&lt; n$, \\textbf{$q$ is $even$} , $2\\le k\\le10^{5}$ ), denoting the size of $S$, the version of the game, the number of the numbers already taken, the parameter denoting the length of increasing subsequence.<br><br><br>The second line contains $q$ integers denoting numbers taken out alreadly in order by steps.<br><br>It is guaranteed that $\\sum n, \\sum q \\in [1,10^{6}]$.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case:<br><br><br>If Alice can&apos;t win, print a single line containing &quot;$NO$&quot;.<br><br><br>Otherwise, print a single line containing &quot;$YES$&quot; and an integer which denotes the number of different operations Alice can take in the next step to win with only one space seperated.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n3 1 2 3\n3 2\n4 2 2 3\n4 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">YES 1\nNO</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2020+Multi-University+Training+Contest+5&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2020 Multi-University Training Contest 5 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
