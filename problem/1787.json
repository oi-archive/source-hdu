Oh, you must do this when you want to become a &quot;Big Cattle&quot;.<br>Now you will find that this problem is so familiar:<br>The greatest common divisor GCD (a, b) of two positive integers a and b, sometimes written (a, b), is the largest divisor common to a and b. For example, (1, 2) =1, (12, 18) =6. (a, b) can be easily found by the Euclidean algorithm. Now I am considering a little more difficult problem: <br>Given an integer N, please count the number of the integers M (0&lt;M&lt;N) which satisfies (N,M)&gt;1.<br>This is a simple version of problem &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;GCD&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; which you have done in a contest recently,so I name this problem &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;GCD Again&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;.If you cannot solve it still,please take a good think about your method of study.<br>Good Luck!<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input contains multiple test cases.
