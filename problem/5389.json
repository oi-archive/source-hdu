The process continues until a single-digit number is reached.<br>For example, the digital root of $65536$ is $7$, because $6 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 6 = 25$ and $2 + 5 = 7$.<br><br>In the game, every player has a special identifier. Maybe two players have the same identifier, but they are different players. If a group of players want to get into a door numbered $X(1\\leq X\\leq 9)$, the digital root of their identifier sum must be $X$.<br>For example, players $\\{1,2,6\\}$ can get into the door $9$,  but players $\\{2,3,3\\}$ can&apos;t.<br><br>There is two doors, numbered $A$ and $B$. Maybe $A=B$, but they are two different door.<br>And there is $n$ players, everyone must get into one of these two doors. Some players will get into the door $A$, and others will get into the door $B$.<br>For example: <br>players are $\\{1,2,6\\}$, $A=9$, $B=1$<br>There is only one way to distribute the players: all players get into the door $9$. Because there is no player to get into the door $1$, the digital root limit of this door will be ignored.<br><br>Given the identifier of every player, please calculate how many kinds of methods are there, $mod~258280327$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains a single number $T$, the number of test cases.<br>For each test case, the first line contains three integers $n$, $A$ and $B$.<br>Next line contains $n$ integers $id_i$, describing the identifier of every player.<br>$T\\leq 100$, $n\\leq 10^5$, $\\sum n\\leq 10^6$, $1\\leq A,B,id_i\\leq 9$","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output a single integer in a single line, the number of ways that these $n$ players can get into these two doors.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4\n3 9 1\n1 2 6\n3 9 1\n2 3 3\n5 2 3\n1 1 1 1 1\n9 9 9\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n0\n10\n60</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"SXYZ","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2015+Multi-University+Training+Contest+8&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2015 Multi-University Training Contest 8 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
