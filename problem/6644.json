One day, 11 Dimensions came across a problem but didn&apos;t manage to solve it. Today you are taking training here, so 11 Dimensions turns to you for help.<br><br>You are given a decimal integer $S$ with $n$ bits $s_1s_2\\dots s_n(0\\leq s_i\\leq 9)$, but some bits can not be recognized now(replaced by ``$\\texttt{?}$&apos;&apos;). The only thing you know is that $S$ is a multiple of a given integer $m$.<br><br>There may be many possible values of the original $S$, please write a program to find the $k$-th smallest value among them. Note that you need to answer $q$ queries efficiently.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T(1\\leq T\\leq 10000)$, denoting the number of test cases.<br><br>In each test case, there are three integers $n,m,q(1\\leq n\\leq 50000,2\\leq m\\leq 20,1\\leq q\\leq 100000)$ in the first line, denoting the length of $S$, the parameter $m$, and the number of queries.<br><br>In the second line, there is a string $s$ of length $n$, denoting the given decimal integer $S$. It is guaranteed that $s_i$ is either an integer within $[0,9]$ or ``$\\texttt{?}$&apos;&apos;, and $s_1$ is always an integer within $[1,9]$.<br><br>For the next $q$ lines, each line contains an integer $k_i(1\\leq k_i\\leq 10^{18})$, denoting each query.<br><br>It is guaranteed that $\\sum n\\leq 500000$ and $\\sum q\\leq 10^6$.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each query, print a single line containing an integer, denoting the value of $S$.
