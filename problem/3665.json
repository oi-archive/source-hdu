In each cases the first line contains an integer N (0&lt;=N&lt;=10), indicating the number of the towns. Then followed N blocks of data, in block-i there are two integers, Mi (0&lt;=Mi&lt;=N-1) and Pi, then Mi lines followed. Mi means there are Mi roads beginning with the i-th town. Pi indicates whether the i-th town is near to the sea, Pi=0 means No, Pi=1 means Yes. In next Mi lines, each line contains two integers S<sub>Mi</sub> and L<sub>Mi</sub>, which means that the distance between the i-th town and the S<sub>Mi</sub> town is L<sub>Mi</sub>.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Each case takes one line, print the shortest length that XiaoY reach seaside.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5\n1 0\n1 1\n2 0\n2 3\n3 1\n1 1\n4 100\n0 1\n0 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2010+Asia+Regional+Harbin&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2010 Asia Regional Harbin </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
