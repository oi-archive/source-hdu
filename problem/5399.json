But Teacher Mai thought this problem was too simple, sometimes naive. So she ask you for help.<br><br>Teacher Mai has $m$ functions $f_1,f_2,\\cdots,f_m:\\{1,2,\\cdots,n\\}\\to\\{1,2,\\cdots,n\\}$(that means for all $x \\in \\{1,2,\\cdots,n\\},f(x)\\in \\{1,2,\\cdots,n\\}$). But Rhason only knows some of these functions, and others are unknown.<br><br>She wants to know how many different function series $f_1,f_2,\\cdots,f_m$ there are that for every $i(1\\leq i\\leq n)$,$f_1(f_2(\\cdots f_m(i)))=i$. Two function series $f_1,f_2,\\cdots,f_m$ and $g_1,g_2,\\cdots,g_m$ are considered different if and only if there exist $i(1\\leq i\\leq m),j(1\\leq j\\leq n)$,$f_i(j)\\neq g_i(j)$.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"For each test case, the first lines contains two numbers $n,m(1\\leq n,m\\leq 100)$.<br><br>The following are $m$ lines.
