Here, we develop a simple encoding scheme that encodes particular types of words with five or fewer (lower case) letters as integers. <br>Consider the English alphabet {a,b,c,...,z}. Using this alphabet, a set of valid words are to be formed that are in a strict lexicographic order. In this set of valid words, the successive letters of a word are in a strictly ascending order; that is, later letters in a valid word are always after previous letters with respect to their positions in the alphabet list {a,b,c,...,z}. For example, <br><br>abc aep gwz <br><br><br>are all valid three-letter words, whereas <br><br>aab are cat <br><br><br>are not. <br><br>For each valid word associate an integer which gives the position of the word in the alphabetized list of words. That is: <br><br>a -&gt; 1<br>b -&gt; 2<br>.<br>.<br>z -&gt; 26<br>ab -&gt; 27<br>ac -&gt; 28<br>.<br>.<br>az -&gt; 51<br>bc -&gt; 52<br>.<br>.<br>vwxyz -&gt; 83681<br><br>Your program is to read a series of input lines. Each input line will have a single word on it, that will be from one to five letters long. For each word read, if the word is invalid give the number 0. If the word read is valid, give the word&apos;s position index in the above alphabetical list. <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of a series of single words, one per line.
