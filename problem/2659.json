They usually played some game after they came back from lab. One day, Yifenfei came up with an idea about a new game. That game&apos;s rules are as follows:<br>Yifenfei provides a positive integer n, Lemon and CTW should give 3 positive integers x, y and z in a limited time. The winner is who make the |n - x * y * z| as small as possible. If the value of |n - x * y * z| is tied, the rusult is determined by smaller x, then smaller y, then smaller z, until the winner appear. To make this game more diffcult, Yifenfei will also give a list of positive integers, x, y and z cannot be included in this list.<br>Because Lemon is so smart, CTW never win even one game. Can you provides CTW a program to help him to get the optimum answer?<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input includes several cases.
