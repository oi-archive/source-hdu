The first proof of the four-color problem was completed with the assistance of a computer program and current efforts in verification have succeeded in verifying the translation of high-level code down to the chip level. <br><br>This problem deals with computing quantities relating to part of Fermat&apos;s Last Theorem: that there are no integer solutions of <img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1615-1.gif\"> for n &gt; 2. <br><br>Given a positive integer N, you are to write a program that computes two quantities regarding the solution of <br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1615-2.gif\"><br><br>where x, y, and z are constrained to be positive integers less than or equal to N. You are to compute the number of triples (x,y,z) such that x&lt;y&lt; z, and they are relatively prime, i.e., have no common divisor larger than 1. You are also to compute the number of values 0&lt;p&#x2264;n such that p is not part of any triple (not just relatively prime triples). <br><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of a sequence of positive integers, one per line.
