This robot is controlled by a program {D<sub>i</sub>}, which is a finite sequence of non-negative &#x201C;jumping distances&#x201D;. The program can&#x2019;t be changed once the robot is made.<br>There are L boxes in a line. Each time the robot is placed in one of the boxes, facing left or right, and then it is turned on. It first jumps over D<sub>1</sub> boxes, then jumps over D<sub>2</sub> boxes ...<br>Ali writes a capital letter in each box. The robot prints out all the letter it touches, including the initial one. Now he wants to design a program with a length of p, so that for every kind of letters in the boxes, if you carefully choose the initial position and direction of the robot, it can print out a sequence of that letter of length p.<br>What&#x2019;s the maximum possible p for the given letters in boxes?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists several testcases.<br>The first line contains 2 integers n (4 &lt;= n &lt;= 8) and L (4 &lt;= L &lt;= 100), represents the number of different capital letters and the number of boxes.<br>The second line contains a string whose length is exactly L, represents the letters in each box.
