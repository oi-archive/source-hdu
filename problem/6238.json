To help his cows learning addition and multiplication, he invented a new game. In the beginning, he would provide two number $a$ and $b$. After that, cows would report two number each turn. At the turn $i$, $i\\times a$ and $i \\times b$ should be reported. Once there exists an integer in the segment $[i \\times a, i \\times b]$, the game ends. Now, John wants to know after how many turns the game would end. So, he ask for your help.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is the number of test cases.
