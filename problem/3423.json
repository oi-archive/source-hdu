There are some stations and roads in the city now, any road has a cost. To save money, you decided not to construct every road, but to make sure that there exist a path between every two stations.<br>Sorry, the mission isn&apos;t completed. You know, there are n stations in the city,some contestants visit other stations regularly to admire some so-called big cows. Being naturally averse to spending hours each day on commuting, you should help them to find a place to live for which the total travel time is minimal.<br>Every road has an ID, from 1 to m. If there are multiple approaches leading to the same minimal cost, the mayor prefers the one of which road IDs selected holds the smallest lexicographic order. For instance, rebuilding ID ( 1 3 5) and ID (2 4 5) will both ensure the minimum cost,the mayor will choose the former one.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"First,a number t,indicating the number of the testcases.<br>For every testcase, there is a number n and m,n(1&lt;=n&lt;=50000) indicating the number of cities,whereas m (0&lt;=m&lt;=500000) indicating the number of roads.<br>then m lines follow each lines contains three integers a,b,c.(1&lt;=a,b&lt;=n&amp;&amp;a!=b,1&lt;=c&lt;=10000)which means there is a road from a to b whose cost is c.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"First the minimum cost.If doesn&apos;t exist,only output &quot;Poor mayor.&quot;(without quotes)<br>Then output the answer and all the candidate stations.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n3 3\n1 2 10\n2 3 20\n3 1 15\n3 1\n1 2 15\n2 1\n1 2 15</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">25\n1\n50\nPoor mayor.\n15\n1 2\n30\n\n\nHint:\nIn the first sample we use road 1 and 3 ,the minimus cost is 10+15=25\nand we get a new graph 3-1-2,city 1 is the best answer ,2*10+2*15=50\nWhereas the third, we can&apos;t get city 1,2,3 connected.\nIn the last, we choose the road 1,the minimus cost is 15\nand we get a new graph 1-2,both city 1 and city 2 are the best answer ,2*15=30</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"daizhenyang@BUPT","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=HDOJ+Monthly+Contest+%A8C+2010.06.05&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> HDOJ Monthly Contest &#xFFFD;C 2010.06.05 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
