The diameter of all the trees are the same  (the diameter of a tree is  1 unit). Kiki can calculate the minimal length of the rope , because it&apos;s so easy for this smart girl.<br>But we don&apos;t have a rope to surround the trees. Instead, we only have some circle rings of different radius. Now I want to know the minimal required radius of the circle ring. And I don&apos;t want to ask her this problem, because she is busy preparing for the examination.<br>As a smart ACMer, can you help me ?<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C133-1004-2.jpg\"></center>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains one or more data sets.
