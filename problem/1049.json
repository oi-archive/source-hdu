It has enough energy to climb u inches every minute, but then has to rest a minute before climbing again. During the rest, it slips down d inches. The process of climbing and resting then repeats. How long before the worm climbs out of the well? We&apos;ll always count a portion of a minute as a whole minute and if the worm just reaches the top of the well at the end of its climbing, we&apos;ll assume the worm makes it out.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There will be multiple problem instances.
