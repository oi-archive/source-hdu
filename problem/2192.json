In MagicStar the problem is much worse.  Dr. Mathematica is trying to save land by clustering buildings and then we call the set of buildings MagicBuilding. Now we can treat the buildings as a square of size d, and the height doesn&apos;t matter. Buildings of d1,d2,d3....dn can be clustered into one MagicBuilding if they satisfy di != dj(i != j). <br>Given  a series of buildings size , you need to calculate the minimal numbers of MagicBuildings that can be made. Note that one building can also be considered as a MagicBuilding.<br>Suppose there are five buildings : 1, 2, 2, 3, 3. We make three MagicBuildings (1,3), (2,3), (2) .And we can also make two MagicBuilding :(1,2,3), (2,3). There is at least two MagicBuildings obviously.
