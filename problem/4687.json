Girls in Gensokyo cannot wait for participating it. Before the registration, they have to decide which combination they are going to compete as. Every girl in Gensokyo is both a boke (funny girl) and a tsukkomi (straight girl). Every candidate combination is made up of two girls, a boke and a tsukkomi. A girl may belong to zero or more candidate combinations, but one can only register as a member of one formal combination. The host of Touhou M-1 Grand Prix hopes that as many formal combinations as possible can participate in this year. Under these constraints, some candidate combinations are actually redundant as it\\&apos;s impossible to register it as a formal one as long as the number of formal combinations has to be maximized. So they want to figure out these redundant combinations and stop considering about them.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C463-1002-1.jpg\"></center>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
