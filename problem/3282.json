The first line of each data set contains the data set number, followed by a space, followed by an odd decimal integer M, (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; M &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 9999), giving the total number of signed integers to be processed.<br>The remaining line(s) in the dataset consists of the values, 10 per line, separated by a single space.<br>The last line in the dataset may contain less than 10 values.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each data set the first line of output contains the data set number, a single space and the number of medians output (which should be one-half the number of input values plus one).
