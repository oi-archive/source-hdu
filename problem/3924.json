But now, I&#x2019;m tired of it. In this problem, we will not talk about the binary tree again, we discuss the tree which has three sub-trees, we called it extend tree;<br><br>The extend tree is orderly, it means that every integer n(n&gt;=0) correspond to one unique extend tree and each extend tree correspond to one unique number. The tree is numbered using the following scheme:<br><br>1. The empty tree is numbered 0;<br>2. The single-node tree is numbered 1;<br>3. All extend trees that has m nodes correspond to a smaller integer than the tree which has more than m nodes.<br>4. Any <font color=\"red\">extend</font> tree having m nodes with left, mid and right sub-trees L ,M and R is numbered n; such that all trees having m nodes numbered &gt; n have either Left sub-trees numbered higher than L, or A left sub-tree  = L and a mid sub-tree numbered higher than M, or a left sub-tree = L a mid sub-tree = M and a right sub-tree numbered higher than R.<br><br>The first 18 extend trees are show below:<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C355-1005-1.jpg\"></center> <br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C355-1005-2.jpg\"></center> <br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C355-1005-3.jpg\"></center> <br>Your job for this problem is to output a extend tree when its order number is given.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single positive integer T( T &lt;= 3000 ), indicating the number of datasets.<br>Each instance consist of a single integer n, where 1&lt;= n &lt;=10^14.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each problem instance, you should output one line containing the tree corresponding to the order number for that instance.
