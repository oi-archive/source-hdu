The problem is, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;A gun is shooting the plane, what&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s the probability for the bullets to be absorbed by each key point&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;? <br>The plane is a rectangle whose height and width equals 1. Points in plane can be defined as ( x, y ),  0 &lt; x &lt; 1 , 0 &lt; y &lt; 1. When shooting, the bullets follow the distribution below:<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C400-1008-2.jpg\"></center><br>After a bullet falls into the plane, it will be absorbed by the nearest key point.
