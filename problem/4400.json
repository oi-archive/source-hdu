The police evacuate all people in time before any mine explodes. Now the police want all the mines be ignited. The police will take many operations to do the job. In each operation, the police will ignite one mine. Every mine has its &quot;power distance&quot;. When a mine explodes, any other mine within the power distance of the exploding mine will also explode. Please NOTE that the distance is Manhattan distance here.<br><br>More specifically, we put the mines in the Cartesian coordinate system. Each mine has position (x,y) and power distance d.<br><br>The police want you to write a program and calculate the result of each operation.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases.<br>In each test case:<br>Line 1: an integer N, indicating that there are N mines.
