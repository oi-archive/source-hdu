Bob also has \\(m\\) functions whose domain and codomain are both \\(\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}\\). Bob and Alice begin to play a game on the array. Alice plays first. For each turn, the player can choose a function \\(f\\) and make every \\(a_i\\ (1 \\le i \\le n)\\) become \\(f(a_i)\\). For example, the array is \\(\\{1, 1, 2, 4, 5\\}\\) and \\(f(1) = 1, f(2) = 3, f(3) = 4, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 2\\). Then after the operation the array will become \\(\\{1, 1, 3, 1, 2\\}\\). If all the element in the array is same, then Alice wins and the game stops. So you can see that Bob&apos;s goal is to stop Alice. Suppose that both Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice wants to know if she can always win no matter what the array looks like.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
