The new top card is dealt face up onto the table. It is the Ace of Spades.<br>2.Two cards are moved one at a time from the top to the bottom. The next card is dealt face up onto the table. It is the Two of Spades.<br>3.Three cards are moved one at a time&#x2026;<br>4.This goes on until the nth and last card turns out to be the n of Spades.<br>This impressive trick works if the magician knows how to arrange the cards beforehand (and knows how to give a false shuffle).
