You are being called to account for your actions and will be judged accordingly. If you have acted in a way that is in alignment with your Higher Self and for the greater good of others, you have nothing to worry about. However, if you have<br>acted in a way that is out of alignment, you will be called out and required to own up to your actions. If this has you shaking in your boots, know that the Justice card isn&#x2019;t as black and white as you may think.</i><br><br>On the table there are n weights. On the body of the i-th weight carved a positive integer $k_i$ , indicating that its weight is $\\frac{1}{2^{k_i}}$ gram. Is it possible to divide the n weights into two groups and make sure that the sum of the weights in each group is greater or equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$ gram? That&#x2019;s on your call.
