Aoshu is very popular in elementary schools. Nowadays, Aoshu is getting more and more difficult. Here is a classic Aoshu problem:<br><br><br>ABBDE __ ABCCC = BDBDE<br><br>In the equation above, a letter stands for a digit(0 &#x2013; 9), and different letters stands for different digits. You can fill the blank with &#x2018;+&#x2019;, &#x2018;-&#x2018; , &#x2018;&#xD7;&#x2019; or &#x2018;&#xF7;&#x2019;. <br><br>How to make the equation right? Here is a solution:<br><br><br>12245 + 12000 = 24245<br><br>In that solution, A = 1, B = 2, C = 0, D = 4, E = 5, and &#x2018;+&#x2019; is filled in the blank.<br><br>When I was a kid, finding a solution is OK. But now, my daughter&#x2019;s teacher tells her to find all solutions. That&#x2019;s terrible. I doubt whether her teacher really knows how many solutions are there. So please write a program for me to solve this kind of problems.<br><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input is an integer T( T &lt;= 20) indicating the number of test cases.<br><br>Each test case is a line which is in the format below:<br><br><br>s1 s2 s3 <br><br>s1, s2 and s3 are all strings which are made up of capital letters. Those capital letters only include &#x2018;A&#x2019;,&#x2019;B&#x2019;,&#x2019;C&#x2019;,&#x2019;D&#x2019; and &#x2018;E&#x2019;, so forget about &#x2018;F&#x2019; to &#x2018;Z&#x2019;.
