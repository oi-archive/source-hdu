One day, kAc asked Sakura to paint a wall that looks like an $M \\times N$ matrix. The wall has $M \\times N$ squares in all. In the whole problem we denotes $(x, y)$ to be the square at the $x$-th row, $y$-th column. Once Sakura has determined two squares $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, she can use the magical tool to paint all the squares in the sub-matrix which has the given two squares as corners.<br><br>However, Sakura is a very naughty girl, so she just randomly uses the tool for $K$ times. More specifically, each time for Sakura to use that tool, she just randomly picks two squares from all the $M \\times N$ squares, with equal probability. Now, kAc wants to know the expected number of squares that will be painted eventually.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer $T$($T \\le 100$), denoting the number of test cases.<br><br>For each test case, there is only one line, with three integers $M, N$ and $K$.<br>It is guaranteed that $1 \\le M, N \\le 500$, $1 \\le K \\le 20$.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output &apos;&apos;Case #t:&apos;&apos; to represent the $t$-th case, and then output the expected number of squares that will be painted.
