Astronauts, War Heroes, Olympians &#x2014; you&#x2019;re here because we want the best, and you are it. That said, it&#x2019;s time to make some science.<br>Now, I want each of you to stand on one of these buttons. Well done, we&#x2019;re making great progress here. Now let&#x2019;s do it again. Oh, come on - don&#x2019;t stand on the same button! Move, people! No, no, that button&#x2019;s only for the Astronauts, you know who you are. What?! You say you can&#x2019;t do everything I ask? Ok let&#x2019;s start over. You there, the Programmer, figure out how many times we can do this. And make it quick, we have a lot more science to get through&#x2026;","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There will be several test cases in the input. The first line of each case will contain <strong>n</strong> (2&#x2264;<strong>n</strong>&#x2264;80) giving the number of people (and the number of buttons) in the experiment. The next <strong>n</strong> lines will contain <strong>n</strong> characters each. If the j<sup>th</sup> character of the i<sup>th</sup> line is <strong>Y</strong> it indicates that the i<sup>th</sup> person can stand on the j<sup>th</sup> button (it is <strong>N</strong> otherwise). The last line of input will be a 0.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output <strong>k</strong>, the maximum number of times everyone can be standing on buttons such that nobody stands on the same button more than once (This might be 0). After that, output <strong>k</strong> lines. Each line should contain <strong>n</strong> integers separated by single spaces, where the i<sup>th</sup> integer describes which person is standing on the i<sup>th</sup> button. All of the lines should be valid and none of them should put the same person on the same button as a previous line of the same test case. Output no extra spaces, and do not separate answers with blank lines. Note that correct outputs might not be unique.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\nYYY\nNYY\nYNY\n2\nYN\nYN\n0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n3 1 2\n1 2 3\n0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=The+University+of+Chicago+Invitational+Programming+Contest+2012&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> The University of Chicago Invitational Programming Contest 2012 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
