If you have seen it, you must be impressed by the scene of the exciting fight between dinosaurs and King Kong, right? Though the dinosaurs have been fight off, King Kong has been injured very heavily. Considering that dinosaurs will come back very quickly, King Kong brings a lot of stones for fear that the dinosaurs attack again. <br>Now King Kong has arranged the stones at random in one line. But Different alignments of these stones would be different to King Kong. If the alignment is not the target in his mind, he will move the stones to their proper positions. Taking the physical consumption into consideration, King Kong could swap only two stones (whose weight is a and b weight units) at one time and for each time he will consume a+b thermal units. In order to minimize the physical consumption, King Kong should set a plan to move these stones. But this is too complex for king Kong and he needs your help.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases.
