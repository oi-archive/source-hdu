We say there exists a black cross centered at the black cell (x,y) if there are four positive integer L,R,U,D that the cell(x,y-L),(x,y+R),(x-U,y),(x+D,y) are all black. Note that if two crosses have the same center but different L,R,U,D, we consider they are distinct.We use 1 to describe black.<br><br>For example<br><br>00100<br>00100<br>11111<br>00100<br>00100<br>00000<br><br>There are 16 black crosses.<br><br>The MM and NN are large, so we divide the matrix into M&#xD7;N rectangle blocks.If two cells are in the same block ,their colors are same.<br><br>So we can divide the sample into 4&#xD7;3 blocks.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are at most 100 cases.<br><br>In every case,there are two integers, M, N in the first line.
