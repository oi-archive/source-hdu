She paints GFW(Great Funny Wall) every day. Every day before painting, she produces a wonderful color of pigments by mixing water and some bags of pigments. On the K-th day, she will select K specific bags of pigments and mix them to get a color of pigments which she will use that day. When she mixes a bag of pigments with color A and a bag of pigments with color B, she will get pigments with color A xor B.<br>When she mixes two bags of pigments with the same color, she will get color zero for some strange reasons. Now, her husband Mr.Fang has no idea about which K bags of pigments Ms.Fang will select on the K-th day. He wonders the sum of the colors Ms.Fang will get with<img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C488-1009-1.jpg\"> different plans.<br><br>For example, assume n = 3, K = 2 and three bags of pigments with color 2, 1, 2. She can get color 3, 3, 0 with 3 different plans. In this instance, the answer Mr.Fang wants to get on the second day is 3 + 3 + 0 = 6.<br>Mr.Fang is so busy that he doesn&#x2019;t want to spend too much time on it. Can you help him?<br>You should tell Mr.Fang the answer from the first day to the n-th day.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases, please process till EOF.<br>For each test case, the first line contains a single integer N(1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10<sup>3</sup>).The second line contains N integers.
