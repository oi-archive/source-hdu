He is going to organize a running competition between his robots. And he is going to give some presents to the winners. Robots are arranged in a line. They have their initial position (distance from the start line) and acceleration speed. These values might be different. When the competition starts, all robots move to the right with speed: <br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C879-1009-1.png\"></center><br><br>Here a is acceleration speed and t is time from starting moment.<br><br>Now, the problem is that, how many robots can be the leader from the starting moment?<br><br>Here leader means the unique rightmost robot from the start line at some moment. That is, at some specific time, if a robot is rightmost and unique then it is the leading robot at that time. There can be robots with same initial position and same acceleration speed.<br><br>The runway is so long that you can assume there&apos;s no finish line.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of an integer N(0 &lt; N&#x2264; 50000), indicating the number of robots.
