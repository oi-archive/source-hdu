The screen also contains a number $s$, which is initially $0$.<br><br>There is a button on each cell. When the $i$-th is pushed, Mike observes that, the number on the screen will be changed to $s + a_i$, where $s$ is the original number. and the number on the $i$-th cell will be changed to $a_i^2$.<br><br>Mike observes that the number is stored in radix $p$, where $p = 9223372034707292160$.
