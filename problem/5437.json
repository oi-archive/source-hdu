Each of her friends will bring a gift of some value $v$, and all of them will come at a different time. Because the lobby is not large enough, Alisha can only let a few people in at a time. She decides to let the person whose gift has the highest value enter first.<br><br>Each time when Alisha opens the door, she can decide to let $p$ people enter her castle. If there are less than $p$ people in the lobby, then all of them would enter. And after all of her friends has arrived, Alisha will open the door again and this time every friend who has not entered yet would enter.<br><br>If there are two friends who bring gifts of the same value, then the one who comes first should enter first.
