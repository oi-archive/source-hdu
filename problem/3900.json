In one step, you can move only one block, and you can move multiple units. To clear the puzzle, you have to move the red block out of the board. The red block can only move in horizontal direction. The vertical blocks can move in vertical direction only. The horizontal blocks can move in horizontal direction only.<br>Now try to crack it. The board is 6*6. There are two kinds of vertical blocks (1*2, 1*3), and two kinds of horizontal blocks (2*1, 3*1).
