First, we find all the substrings of the password. Then we calculate the maximum length of those substrings which, at the meantime, is a palindrome.<br>A palindrome is a string that will be the same when writing backwards. For example, aba, abba,abcba are all palindromes, but abcab, abab are not.<br>A substring of S is a continous string cut from S. bcd, cd are the substrings of abcde, but acd,ce are not. Note that abcde is also the substring of abcde.<br>The smaller the value is, the safer the password will be.<br>You want to set your password using the first M letters from the alphabet, and its length should be N. Output a password with the smallest value. If there are multiple solutions, output the lexicographically smallest one.<br>All the letters are lowercase.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line has a number T (T &lt;= 15) , indicating the number of test cases.<br>For each test case, there is a single line with two integers M and N, as described above.(1 &lt;= M &lt;= 26, 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup>)<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For test case X, output &quot;Case #X: &quot; first, then output the best password.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n2 2\n2 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: ab\nCase #2: aab</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2013+ACM%2FICPC+Asia+Regional+Chengdu+Online&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2013 ACM/ICPC Asia Regional Chengdu Online </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
