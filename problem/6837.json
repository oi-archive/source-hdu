At every moment, the $i$-th of them has a probability of $u_i/v_i(1 \\leq u_i &lt; v_i&lt;P=31607)$ to become visible. All stars are independent of each other. The position of a star can be described as a coordinate on a 2D plane. No two stars share the same coordinate. Your task is to compute the expectation value of the area of the convex hull formed by the visible stars.<br>Formally, let $P = 31607$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{P}$. Output the integer equal to $p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod P$. In other words, output such an integer $x$ that $0 \\le x &lt; P$ and $x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{P}$.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \\le T \\le 100$), denoting the number of test cases.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains a single integer $n$$(1 \\le n \\le 1000)$, denoting the number of stars.<br><br>Each of the following $n$ lines describes a stars.
