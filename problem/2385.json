This obviously gives them a great advantage on the stock market. <br><br>In the past, Optiver made a deal with a big company, which forces them to buy shares of the company according to a fixed schedule. Unfortunately, Optiver&apos;s model has determined that the company will go bankrupt after exactly n days, after which their shares will become worthless. <br><br>Still, Optiver holds a large number of sell options that allows them to sell some of the shares before the company goes bankrupt. However, there is a limit on the number of shares Optiver can sell every day, and price Optiver receives for a share may vary from day to day. Therefore, it is not immediately clear when Optiver should sell their shares to maximize their profit, so they asked you to write a program to calculcate this. <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"On the first line an integer t (1 &lt;= t &lt;= 100): the number of test cases.
