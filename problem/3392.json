After we get their information, we need give each of them an advice for help. We know everyone&#x2019;s height, and we believe that the less difference of a girl and a boy has, the better it is. We need to find as more matches as possible, but the total difference of the matches must be minimum.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers, n, m (0 &lt; n, m &lt;= 10000), which are the number of boys and the number of girls. The next line contains n float numbers, indicating the height of each boy. The last line of each test case contains m float numbers, indicating the height of each girl. You can assume that |n &#x2013; m| &lt;= 100 because we believe that there is no need to do with that if |n &#x2013; m| &gt; 100. All of the values of the height are between 1.5 and 2.0.<br>The last case is followed by a single line containing two zeros, which means the end of the input.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"Output the minimum total difference of the height.
