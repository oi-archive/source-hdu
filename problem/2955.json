He wants to make a calculated risk, and grab as much money as possible.<br><br><br>His mother, Ola, has decided upon a tolerable probability of getting caught. She feels that he is safe enough if the banks he robs together give a probability less than this.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input gives T, the number of cases. For each scenario, the first line of input gives a floating point number P, the probability Roy needs to be below, and an integer N, the number of banks he has plans for.
