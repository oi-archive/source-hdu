Rows are numbered $1, 2, \\cdots$ from the bottom, so are the columns. At first the frog is sitting at grid $(s_x, s_y)$, and begins his journey.<br><br>To show his girlfriend his talents in math, he uses a special way of jump. If currently the frog is at the grid $(x, y)$, first of all, he will find the minimum $z$ that can be divided by both $x$ and $y$, and jump exactly $z$ steps to the up, or to the right. So the next possible grid will be $(x + z, y)$, or $(x, y + z)$.<br><br>After a finite number of steps (perhaps zero), he finally finishes at grid $(e_x, e_y)$. However, he is too tired and he forgets the position of his starting grid!<br><br>It will be too stupid to check each grid one by one, so please tell the frog the number of possible starting grids that can reach $(e_x, e_y)$!","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"First line contains an integer $T$, which indicates the number of test cases.<br><br>Every test case contains two integers $e_x$ and $e_y$, which is the destination grid.<br><br>$\\cdot$ $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$.<br>$\\cdot$ $1 \\leq e_x, e_y \\leq 10^9$.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For every test case, you should output &quot;<b>Case #x: y</b>&quot;, where $x$ indicates the case number and counts from $1$ and $y$ is the number of possible starting grids.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n6 10\n6 8\n2 8</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 1\nCase #2: 2\nCase #3: 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2015ACM%2FICPC%D1%C7%D6%DE%C7%F8%C9%CF%BA%A3%D5%BE-%D6%D8%CF%D6%C8%FC%A3%A8%B8%D0%D0%BB%BB%AA%B6%AB%C0%ED%B9%A4%A3%A9&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2015ACM/ICPC&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x3FA;&#xFFFD;&#x57E;-&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x43B;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
