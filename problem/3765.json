Each of their N mansions has a value between 1,000,000 and 40,000,000 dollars. Jack will receive some of the mansions; Jill will receive some of the mansions; the remaining mansions will be sold, and the proceeds split equally.<br><br>Neither Jack nor Jill can tolerate the other receiving property with higher total value. The sum of the values of the mansions Jack receives must be equal to the sum of the values of the mansions Jill receives. So long as the value that each receives is equal, Jack and Jill would like each to receive property of the highest possible value.<br><br>Given the values of N mansions, compute the value of the mansions that must be sold so that the rest may be divided so as to satisfy Jack and Jill.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of a sequence of test cases.
