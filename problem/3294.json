Operation contains two steps:<br>First step: girls will write a long string (only contains lower case) on the paper. For example, &quot;abcde&quot;, but &apos;a&apos; inside is not the real &apos;a&apos;, that means if we define the &apos;b&apos; is the real &apos;a&apos;, then we can infer that &apos;c&apos; is the real &apos;b&apos;, &apos;d&apos; is the real &apos;c&apos; &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, &apos;a&apos; is the real &apos;z&apos;. According to this, string &quot;abcde&quot; changes to &quot;bcdef&quot;.<br>Second step: girls will find out the longest palindromic string in the given string, the length of palindromic string must be equal or more than 2.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input contains multiple cases.<br>Each case contains two parts, a character and a string, they are separated by one space, the character representing the real &apos;a&apos; is and the length of the string will not exceed 200000.All input must be lowercase.<br>If the length of string is len, it is marked from 0 to len-1.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Please execute the operation following the two steps.<br>If you find one, output the start position and end position of palindromic string in a line, next line output the real palindromic string, or output &quot;No solution!&quot;.<br>If there are several answers available, please choose the string which first appears.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">b babd\na abcd</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">0 2\naza\nNo solution!</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"wangjing1111","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2010+%A1%B0HDU-Sailormoon%A1%B1+Programming+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2010 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;HDU-Sailormoon&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; Programming Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
