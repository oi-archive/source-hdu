The evil King Koopa noticed that and placed a lot of mushroom on the road. There are two types of mushrooms, max mushrooms and bad mushrooms. The bad mushrooms will decrease Mario&apos;s HP by m points, on the other hand, max mushrooms will increase Mario&apos;s HP by one point. The mushrooms are randomly placed on the track and Mario will receive them one by one. Once Mario&apos;s HP becomes zero or below after he received a mushroom, he will die.<br>Notice that Mario begins with HP zero, so if the first mushroom is bad, Mario will die immediately. Fortunately, if Mario receives all the mushrooms, he will be alive with HP 1. In the other words, if there are k bad mushrooms on the way, there will also be m*k+1 max mushrooms.<br>Princess Peach wants to know the possibility for Mario staying alive. Please help her to calculate it out.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases.
