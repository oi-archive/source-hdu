It was a modern  stadium which could hold thousands of people. The audience Seats made a circle. The total number of columns were 300 numbered  1--300, counted clockwise, we assume the number of rows were infinite.<br>These days, Busoniya want to hold a large-scale theatrical performance in this stadium. There will be N people go there  numbered 1--N. Busoniya has Reserved several seats. To make it funny, he makes M requests for these seats: A B X, which means  people numbered B must seat clockwise X distance from people numbered A. For example: A is in column 4th and X is 2, then B  must in column 6th (6=4+2).<br>Now your task is to judge weather the request is correct or not. The rule of your judgement is easy: when a new request has  conflicts against the foregoing ones then we define it as incorrect, otherwise it is correct. Please find out all the  incorrect requests and count them as R.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are many test cases:<br>For every case: <br>The first line has two integer N(1&lt;=N&lt;=50,000), M(0&lt;=M&lt;=100,000),separated by a space.<br>Then M lines follow, each line has 3 integer A(1&lt;=A&lt;=N), B(1&lt;=B&lt;=N), X(0&lt;=X&lt;300) (A!=B), separated by a space.<br><br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For every case: <br>Output R, represents the number of incorrect request.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">10 10\n1 2 150\n3 4 200\n1 5 270\n2 6 200\n6 5 80\n4 7 150\n8 9 100\n4 8 50\n1 7 100\n9 2 100</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nHint:\n&#xFF08;PS&#xFF1A; the 5th and 10th requests are incorrect&#xFF09;\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2009+Multi-University+Training+Contest+14+-+Host+by+ZJNU&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2009 Multi-University Training Contest 14 - Host by ZJNU </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
