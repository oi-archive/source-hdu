Same numbers denote the same variable. <br>The program runs as follows: <br>If the statement is &quot;a [variable]&quot;, it assigns the variable a new value; <br>If the statement if &quot;u [variable]&quot;, it uses value of the variable to do something interesting; <br>If there is an IF-CLAUSE, it is possible that condition of this clause is satisfied or not satisfied. <br><br>We only need to do liveness analysis on this program. This is why we do not explicitly write assigned values, what we do with the variables and condition of IF-CLAUSEs. <br>In this task, there are three kinds of liveness for each of the variables. <br>1. Live. In one or more paths of this program, value of the variable at the beginning of the program is used. <br>2. Dead. In all paths of this program, the variable is assigned a new value before any use of this variable. <br>3. Half-dead. In all paths of this program, value of the variable at the beginning of the program is not used, but in one or more paths, the variable is never assigned a new value.
