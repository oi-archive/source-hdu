After the war between ZAFT and Earth Alliance, he decided to continue his childhood dream.<br>Sven&#x2019;s new house is located at a peaceful town. What&#x2019;s more, there is a lake in his garden. One day, he came up with a new idea on finding stars using interference phenomenon. He put a radio wave receiver h meter above the surface of a lake. When a radio star rising, it detects maxima successively due to interference of radio waves from the star, and its reflection waves from the water. The wavelength of the waves is &#x3BB; centimeters. Sven wants to find stars as quickly as possible.
