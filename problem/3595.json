At the beginning of game, there are two piles of stones. MM chooses a pile of stones first, which has x stones, and then she can choose a positive number k and remove k*x stones out from the other pile of stones, which has y stones (I think all of you know that y&gt;=k*x - -!). Then it comes the turn of GG, followed the rules above-mentioned as well. When someone can&apos;t remove any stone, then he/she loses the game, and this game is finished.<br>Many years later, GG and MM find this game is too simple, so they decided to play N games at one time for fun. MM plays first, as the same, and the one on his/her turn must play every unfinished game. Rules to remove are as same as above, and if someone cannot remove any stone (i.e., loses the last ending game), then he/she loses. Of course we can assume GG and MM are clever enough, and GG will not lose intentionally, O(&#x2229;_&#x2229;)O~<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file contains multiply test cases (no more than 100).<br>The first line of each test case is an integer N, N&lt;=1000, which represents there are N games, then N lines following, each line has two numbers: p and q, standing for the number of the two piles of stones of each game, p, q&lt;=1000(it seems that they are so leisure = =!), which represent the numbers of two piles of stones of every game.<br>The input will end with EOF.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output the name of the winner.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1\n3 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">MM\nGG</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"alpc95","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2010+ACM-ICPC+Multi-University+Training+Contest%A3%A816%A3%A9%A1%AA%A1%AAHost+by+NUDT&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2010 ACM-ICPC Multi-University Training Contest&#xFF08;16&#xFF09;&#x2014;&#x2014;Host by NUDT </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
