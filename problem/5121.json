Graph problems are his favorite.<br><br>   Once, he came up with a simple algorithm for finding the maximal independent set in trees by mistake.<br><br>   A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles, and an independent set is subset of the vertex set which contains no adjacent vertex pairs.<br><br>   Suppose that the tree contains N vertices, conveniently numbered by 1,2, . . . , N. First, Matt picks a permutation p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, . . . , p<sub>N</sub> of {1, 2, 3, . . . , N } randomly and uniformly.<br><br>   After picking the permutation, Matt does the following procedure.<br><br>   1.Set S =  <img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C556-1010-1.jpg\">.<br>   2.Consider the vertex p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, . . . , p<sub>N</sub> accordingly. For vertex p<sub>i</sub>, if and only if there is no vertex in S which is adjacent to p<sub>i</sub>, add vertex p<sub>i</sub> into S.<br>   3.Output the set S.<br><br>   Clearly the above algorithm does not always output the maximal independent set. Matt would like to know the expected size of set S instead.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"   The first line contains only one integer T , which indicates the number of test cases.<br><br>   For each test case, the first line contains an integer N (1 &#x2264; N &#x2264; 200), indicating the number of vertices in the graph.<br><br>   Each of the following N - 1 lines contains two integers u, v (1 &#x2264; u, v &#x2264; N ) indicating an edge between u and v.
