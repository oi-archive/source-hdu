We can abstract the relationship among $n$ people as an undirected graph $G=\\langle V,E \\rangle$ of size $n$. $(i,j) \\in E$ if and only if the $i$th person and the $j$th person are friends. We can do a lot of analyses of this graph and can get a lot of interesting facts about this human group.<br><br>This semester, Rikka chooses an elective course about anthropoid sociology, and her final project is about the relationship graph. You know, if you want to get a higher GPA, you would better put a lot of time in the elective courses. So, Rikka works hard in this class, and she wants to finish an impressive project. <br><br>Rikka is interested in the &quot;bridges&quot; in the graph. A tuple $(i,j,k)(i &lt;j, k \\notin\\{i,j\\})$ is a bridge if and only if $(i,k),(j,k) \\in E$ and $(i,j) \\notin E$. For bridge $(i,j,k)$, $k$ will be the bridge of the social contacts between $i$ and $j$. The fewer bridges are inside the relationship graph, the more stable the human group will be.<br><br>Rikka wants to study a student group in her college which has $n$ students in it. She wants to verify whether the group is stable enough, i.e., whether the number of bridges in this group is less than or equal to $K$. Rikka has not researched the relationships among the students yet. But she wants to estimate the result at first. Since there are $2^{\\binom{n}{2}}$ possible relationship graphs, she wants to calculate the number of stable graphs among them.<br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer $t(1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3)$, the numebr of testcases.<br><br>For each testcase, the first line contains three numbers $n,K,m(1 \\leq n \\leq 10^3, 0\\leq K \\leq 8,10^8 \\leq m \\leq 10^9+7)$.<br><br>The input gurantees that there are at most $50$ testcases with $n &gt; 100$","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each testcase, output a single line with a single number, the answer modulo $m$.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n4 1 1000000007\n4 2 1000000007\n1000 8 1000000007</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">27\n57\n509805471</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=%BA%AE%CE%E4%BC%CDACM%BD%F0%C5%C6%D1%B5%C1%B7%D3%AA-%D6%D8%CF%D6%C8%FC&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> &#x5BD2;&#x6B66;&#x7EAA;ACM&#x91D1;&#x724C;&#x8BAD;&#x7EC3;&#x8425;-&#x91CD;&#x73B0;&#x8D5B; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
