An s-t cut is a partition of nodes set $V$ into two parts such that $s$ and $t$ belong to different parts. The cut set is the subset of $E$ with all edges connecting nodes in different parts. A minimum cut is the one whose cut set has the minimum summation of capacities. The size of a cut is the number of edges in the cut set. Please calculate the smallest size of all minimum cuts.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases and the first line is the total number of cases $T~(1\\le T\\le 300)$.<br>Each case describes a network $G$, and the first line contains two integers $n~(2\\le n\\le 200)$ and $m~(0\\le m\\le 1000)$ indicating the sizes of nodes and edges.
