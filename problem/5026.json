It is a useful tool for numeric string matching.<br><br>   If S is an NRE, we often use function L(S) to represent the set of numeric strings matched by S. Note that L(S) maybe infinite.<br><br>   NRE and function L can be recursively defined by the following rules:<br><br>   1. Atom: A single digit (0,1,2,...,9) is an NRE, and L(d)={d}, where d=0,1,2,...9.<br><br>   2. Nestification: If x is an NRE, then (x) is an NRE, and L((x))=L(x).<br><br>   3. Concatenation: If x and y are NREs, then xy is an NRE, and L(xy)={ab | a&#x2208;x and b&#x2208;y}.<br><br>   4. Option: If x and y are NREs, then x|y is an NRE, and L(x|y)= L(x)&#x222A;L(y).<br><br>   5. Closure: If x is an NRE, then x* is an NRE, and L(x*)={&#x3B5;, L(x),L(xx),L(xxx),...}, here&#x3B5; means &#x201C;empty string&#x201D;. In other word, x* matches x zero or more times.<br><br>   To avoid confusion, the order of operations (from high to low) is: nestification, closure, concatenation and option. Operations with higher order will be applied first, and same operations will be applied from left to right. For example,<b>01*</b> is equal to <b>0(1*)</b>, not <b>(01)*</b>; <b>00|1</b> is equal to <b>(00)|1</b>, not <b>0(0|1)</b>.<br><br>   Now give you two NERs r1 and r2, can you tell us whether L(r1)=L(r2) or not?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   There are several test cases in the input.<br><br>   The first line contains an integer T (1 &lt;= T &lt;= 50) -- the number of test cases.<br><br>   Each test case contains two lines, the first line is r1 and the second line is r2 (1 &lt;= |r1|,|r2| &lt;= 10).
