The 2 ways are symmetry.<br><br>Here is the question for you, our great programmer. How many ways we can make a laser beam enter the triangle though C and exit though C, and the beam reflects n times in the triangle? e.g. there are 80840 ways when n is 1000001.<br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a number T.(1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;T&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;100) Then the following T line each line contains a number n.(1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;n&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;10<sup>7</sup>)<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each n, print the corresponding result.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">10\n2\n5\n7\n11\n13\n17\n19\n23\n29\n31</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">0\n0\n2\n2\n2\n0\n4\n4\n2\n6</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2013+Multi-University+Training+Contest+5&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2013 Multi-University Training Contest 5 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
