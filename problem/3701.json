It consists of N cities. The indices of the cities are from 0 to N - 1.<br>2. There are exact M roads between cities. A road is a bidirectional path that connects two different cities. There is at most one road between any two cities. There are no roads connect a city to itself.<br>3. You can travel from each city to any other cities using these roads. In other words, all the cities are in one connect component.<br>4. There is exact one special city called centre city X. When X is removed (the roads connect with X are also removed), the cities are partitioned into K parts. There are no roads between any two parts. For each part, you can travel from each city to any other cities in this part (each of the K parts is a connect component).<br>5. Most important of all, each of the K parts is identical to each other.<br><br>Now given N, M, and K, you are asked to construct a valid structure for Country X.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are no more than 100 cases.

Otherwise, you need to output all the M roads in M lines. A road is a pair &quot;A B&quot; meaning there is a road between city A and city B (0 &lt;= A, B &lt; N, A != B). If there are more than one valid structure, you should output the lexicographically smallest list of roads. A list of roads R [R1, R2, ... RM] is lexicographically smaller than Q [Q1, Q2, ... QM] if R contains a smaller road at the first index where they differ. A road &quot;A B&quot; is smaller than the road &quot;C D&quot; if A &lt; C or A = C and B &lt; D.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">7 6 3\n6 6 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">0 1\n0 2\n0 3\n1 4\n2 5\n3 6\nInvalid</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"hhanger@ZJU","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=HDOJ+5th+Anniversary+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> HDOJ 5th Anniversary Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
