As we all know, 16 or any number contains 16 (116 for example) is lucky number for totalfrank and 2 or any number contains 2 (1723 for example) is lucky number for wlkilluajay.<br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Totalfrank is a normal guy who reads from left to right while wlkilluajay enjoys reading from right to left which means 16 to totalfrank is 61 to wlkilluajay.<br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Since their lucky numbers changes often, here is the simple counting question for you: given totalfrank&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s and wlkilluajay&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s lucky number and an interval, how many numbers in the given interval is at least a lucky number for one of them? Notice that wlkilluajay always read from right to left so a number which is outside the interval (in totalfrank&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s perspective) may be inside the interval when it is read from right to left (in wlkilluajay&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s perspective), you should also count that in (See samples for more details). By the way, because they read from different direction, 0 may be a problem (for example, if 2 is a lucky number for wlkilluajay, then 20, 200&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; is also a lucky number for her. But when read from right to left, they are all just 2 and there may be infinite lucky numbers for her in a given interval in a normal guy&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s eyes). From this aspect, they decide to ignore any number contains 0.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains no more than 50 test cases. <br>The first line contains a single integer T indicating the number of test cases.<br>For each test case: <br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;The first line of each test case includes two integers a (1 &lt;= a &lt;= 10<sup>18</sup>) and b (a &lt;= b &lt;= 10<sup>18</sup>).<br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;The second line contains two integers c (1 &lt;= c &lt;= 10<sup>18</sup>) and d (1 &lt;= d &lt;= 10<sup>18</sup>). c is the lucky number for totalfrank and d is the lucky number for wlkilluajay (c and d won&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t contain any 0).","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, first you should print &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Case #x: &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; (without quotes), where x stands for the case number started with 1 and then a single integer indication the answer to the question.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n\n62 62\n62 62\n\n1 9999\n53 23</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 2\nCase #2: 501\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nFor the first case, 62 is a lucky number for totalfrank and 26 is a lucky number for wlkilluajay (when read from right to left, it is 62 which fills in the interval \n[62, 62]).So the answer is 2 (26 and 62).\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2012+Multi-University+Training+Contest+8&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2012 Multi-University Training Contest 8 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
