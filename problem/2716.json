They think they will be able to use secret messages to plot meetings with cows on other farms.<br><br>Cows are not known for their intelligence. Their encryption method is nothing like DES or BlowFish or any of those really good secret coding methods. No, they are using a simple substitution cipher.<br><br>The cows have a decryption key and a secret message. Help them decode it. The key looks like this:<br><br>        yrwhsoujgcxqbativndfezmlpk<br><br><br>Which means that an &apos;a&apos; in the secret message really means &apos;y&apos;; a &apos;b&apos; in the secret message really means &apos;r&apos;; a &apos;c&apos; decrypts to &apos;w&apos;; and so on. Blanks are not encrypted; they are simply kept in place.<br><br>Input text is in upper or lower case, both decrypt using the same decryption key, keeping the appropriate case, of course.
