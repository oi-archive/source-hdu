For a point$(x, y)$, it is regarded as good if and only if $\\gcd(x,y)&gt;1$.<br><br>Dodo bird will walk infinite steps on the plane under the following strategy:<br><br>Assume he is currently at $(x, y)$, let $S$ be the set of good points among $(x-1,y-1),(x-1,y),(x-1,y+1),(x,y-1),(x,y+1),(x+1,y-1),(x+1,y),(x+1,y+1)$, $z$ be the size of $S$. He has a probability of $\\frac{1}{z+1}$ to stay in $(x, y)$, and he also has a probility of $\\frac{z}{z+1}$ to move to a point in $S$. If he chooses to move, the probility of going to any point in $S$ is equal.<br><br>Define $p_t$ as the probability of coming back to $(x_0, y_0)$ after walking $t$ steps, please calculate $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty}p_t$.
