Now he selects some sub-matrices, hoping to find the maximum number. Then he finds that there may be more than one maximum number, he also wants to know the number of them. But soon he find that it is too complex, so he changes his mind, he just want to know whether there is a maximum at the four corners of the sub-matrix, he calls this &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Check corners&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;. It&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s a boring job when selecting too many sub-matrices, so he asks you for help. (For the &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Check corners&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; part: If the sub-matrix has only one row or column just check the two endpoints. If the sub-matrix has only one entry just output &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;yes&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;.)","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases. <br><br>For each test case, the first line contains two integers m, n (1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 300), which is the size of the row and column of the matrix, respectively.
