He often write GNU style macros to optimize the programs. One day pooorman gave him a batch of ugly style c code using nested ternary operator (? :), which makes the code difficult to comprehend.<br><br>Now SuperHacker turn to you for help, he have write a program to collect all the ugly code into a file, he send such file to you. Please write a utility to convert such file into a GNU C marcos header file.

There should be a blank line between each case. Each case should be output as the Sample Output below.<br><br>Each line of the output should be indented well with tab(\\t) as Sample output. The trailing line continuing symbol backslashs(\\) macro end symbol &apos;})&apos; at the last line of a macro should be right aligned with tabs aligned. Each continuing symbol and macro end symbol &apos;})&apos; should be seperated with the code in such line with at least one tab indent.
