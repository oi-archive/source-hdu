If we cut some edges of a cube, the surface of the cube can be unfolded into 2-dimensional space, and the resulting flat shape is called a cube net. There are 11 essentially different cube nets, listed below.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C717-1001-1.jpg\"></center><br><br>In this problem, we consider a generalization of the cube net, called cube hypernet. For each face of a cube, we divide it into $k \\times k$ small square cells. If we cut some edges of these small cells, the surface of the cube can be unfolded into 2-dimensional space, then the resulting flat shape is a cube hypernet. Clearly, cube nets are just a special type of cube hypernets where $k = 1$. The following picture illustrates a cube hypernet and explains how it is formed.<br><br> <center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C717-1001-2.png\"></center><br><br>Identifying cube nets is a relatively easy job; however, this might not be true for cube hypernets. Here comes the challenge. Given a flat shape composed of small squares, determine whether it is a cube hypernet.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input is a single integer $T$ $(1 \\leq T \\leq 30)$, denoting the number of test cases. <br><br>For each test case, the first line contains two integers $h, w$ $(1 \\leq h, w \\leq 100)$, denoting the height and width of the input region.
