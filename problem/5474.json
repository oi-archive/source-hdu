Now for every vertex you will select a vertex randomly and equiprobability, and then add an undirected edge between them (multiple edges and self-loop is allowed). At last you will have a graph with n vertices and n edges. So would you mind telling me what is the expected number of the cut vertices. (If you delete a cut vertex in a graph, the number of connected block in this graph will increase)","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a number T, indicating the number of test cases.($1 \\leq T \\leq 50$)<br>For each case, there are only one number n ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$), as described previously.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each case, first please output &quot;Case #k: &quot;, k is the number of test case.
