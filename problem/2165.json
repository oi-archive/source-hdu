Therefore, you must write a new battle summary analysis tool which takes into account excess ammunition consumption during battle.<br><br>A battle consists of the following elements:<br>&#x2013;&#xA0;&#xA0;Shots. A shot is a circularly explosive countermeasure. A shot has a fixed position and a duration of 2 seconds, during which its radius varies from 0 to 1km and then back to 0 according to the formula:<br> r = (1 &#x2013; (t &#x2013; 1)2)1/2<br>&#x2013;&#xA0;&#xA0;The ground, at y = 0. <br>&#x2013;&#xA0;&#xA0;Missiles. A missile is a point particle that moves at a constant velocity. If a missile collides with a shot, it is neutralized. If a missile hits the ground before being neutralized, it is considered to have hit its target.<br>&#x2013;&#xA0;&#xA0;NOTE 1: If a missile hits a shot, the shot does not disappear &#x2013; it may hit other missiles<br>&#x2013;&#xA0;&#xA0;NOTE 2: Shots of 0 radius cannot hit missiles (e.g. a missile will go through an already expired shot).<br><br>Performance is evaluated on a simple point scale. The performance criteria are as follows:<br>&#x2013;&#xA0;&#xA0;Every neutralized missile adds 1 point.<br>&#x2013;&#xA0;&#xA0;Every missile allowed to hit its target subtracts 5 points.<br>&#x2013;&#xA0;&#xA0;Every unnecessary shot subtracts 20 points. The number of unnecessary shots in a battle is the difference between the actual number of shots fired and size of the minimum subset of those shots that would have neutralized the same number of missiles.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Input will be given in the following format (legend follows):<br>nb<br>nm<br>mx my mdx mdy mt<br>...<br>ns<br>sx sy st<br>...<br>...<br><br>In the following legend, indentation denotes repetition of the indented block a number of times equal to the value of the preceding input item:<br>nb (0 &lt; nb) &#x2013; number of battles<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;nm (0 &lt;= nm &lt;= 20) &#x2013; number of missiles<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;mx/my (0.0 &lt; my) &#x2013; initial missile position (in km)<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;mdx/mdy &#x2013; missile velocity (in km/s)<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;mt (0.0 &lt;= mt) &#x2013; time since battle start of the missile&apos;s entrance (in seconds)<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;ns (0 &lt;= ns &lt;= 20) &#x2013; number of shots<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;sx/sy (1.0 &lt;= sy) &#x2013; shot position at time of detonation (in km)<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;st (0.0 &lt;= st) &#x2013; time since battle start of the shot&apos;s detonation (in seconds)<br><br> <br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each battle, output a line containing the score for that battle.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n2\n4.0 8.0 0.0 -1.0 0.0\n4.0 8.0 1.0 -1.0 0.0\n1\n4.0 4.0 3.0\n3\n4.0 10.0 0.0 -1.0 0.0\n5.0 10.0 3.0 -6.0 4.0\n13.0 10.0 -3.0 -5.0 4.0\n3\n4.0 5.0 3.0\n7.0 8.0 4.0\n9.0 4.0 4.0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">-4\n-17</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2007+ACM-ICPC+Pacific+Northwest+Region&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2007 ACM-ICPC Pacific Northwest Region </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
