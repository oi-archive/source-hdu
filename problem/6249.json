She is now at the post office buying some new stamps.<br>There are $N$ different kinds of stamps that exist in the world; they are numbered $1$ through $N$. However, stamps are not sold individually; they must be purchased in sets. There are $M$ different stamp sets available; the $i^{th}$ set contains the stamps numbered $L_i$ through $R_i$. The same stamp might appear in more than one set, and it is possible that one or more stamps are not available in any of the sets.<br>All of the sets cost the same amount; because Alice has a limited budget, she can buy at most $K$ different sets.
