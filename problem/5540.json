The plan instructs how to deploy soldiers on the four corners of the city wall. Unfortunately, when Fei opened the pocket he found there are only four numbers written in dots on a piece of sheet. The numbers form $2&#xD7;2$ matrix, but Fei didn&apos;t know the correct direction to hold the sheet. What a pity!<br><br>Given two secrete master plans. The first one is the master&apos;s original plan. The second one is the plan opened by Fei. As KongMing had many pockets to hand out, he might give Fei the wrong pocket.
