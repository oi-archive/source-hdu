However, as it was a long long time ago, nobody can remember when it was exactly. The only thing people can remember is that today, the number of days elapsed since their independence (D) is a perfect square, and moreover it is the largest possible such number one can form as a product of distinct numbers less than or equal to n.<br>    As the years in Remoteland have 1,000,000,007 days, their citizens just need D modulo 1,000,000,007. Note that they are interested in the largest D, not in the largest D modulo 1,000,000,007.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"    Every test case is described by a single line with an integer n, (1&lt;=n&lt;=10,000, 000).
