So the year 2008 seems a little special somehow. You are looking forward to it, too, aren&apos;t you? Unfortunately there still are months to go. Take it easy. Luckily you meet me. I have a problem for you to solve. Enjoy your time.<br><br>Now given a positive integer N, get the sum S of all positive integer divisors of 2008<sup>N</sup>. Oh no, the result may be much larger than you can think. But it is OK to determine the rest of the division of S by K. The result is kept as M.<br><br>Pay attention! M is not the answer we want. If you can get 2008<sup>M</sup>, that will be wonderful. If it is larger than K, leave it modulo K to the output. See the example for N = 1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;K = 10000: The positive integer divisors of 20081 are 1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;2&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;4&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;8&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;251&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;502&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;1004&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;2008&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;S = 3780, M = 3780, 2008<sup>M</sup> % K = 5776. <br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases.
