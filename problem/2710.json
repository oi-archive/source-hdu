Unfortunately, he is unaware that the cows interpret some serial numbers as better than others. In particular, a cow whose serial number has the highest prime factor enjoys the highest social standing among all the other cows.<br><br>(Recall that a prime number is just a number that has no divisors except for 1 and itself. The number 7 is prime while the number 6, being divisible by 2 and 3, is not).<br><br>Given a set of N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 5,000) serial numbers in the range 1..20,000, determine the one that has the largest prime factor.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"* Line 1: A single integer, N<br><br>* Lines 2..N+1: The serial numbers to be tested, one per line","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"* Line 1: The integer with the largest prime factor.
