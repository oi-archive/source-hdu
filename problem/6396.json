If $v_1\\geq a_{i,1}$ and $v_2\\geq a_{i,2}$ and $v_3\\geq a_{i,3}$ and $\\dots$ and $v_k\\geq a_{i, k}$, Lawson can kill the $i$-th monster (each monster can be killed for at most one time) and get EXP from the battle, which means $v_j$ will increase $b_{i,j}$ for $j = 1, 2, 3, \\dots, k$.<br>Now we want to know how many monsters Lawson can kill at most and how much Lawson&apos;s magic attributes can be maximized.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
