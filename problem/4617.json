The muzzle of the weapon is a circle. When it fires, rays form a cylinder that runs through the circle verticality in both side. If one cylinder of rays touch another, there will be an horrific explosion. Originally, all circles can rotate easily. But for some unknown reasons they can not rotate any more. If these weapon can also make an explosion, then Doctor D. is lucky that he can also test the power of the weapon. If not, he would try to make an explosion by other means. One way is to find a medium to connect two cylinder. But he need to know the minimum length of medium he will prepare. When the medium connect the surface of the two cylinder, it may make an explosion.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"&#x3000;&#x3000;The first line contains an integer T, indicating the number of testcases. For each testcase, the first line contains one integer N(1 &lt; N &lt; 30), the number of weapons. Each of the next 3N lines&amp;nbsp; contains three float numbers. Every 3 lines represent one weapon. The first line represents the coordinates of center of the circle, and the second line and the third line represent two points in the circle which surrounds the center. It is supposed that these three points are not in one straight line.
