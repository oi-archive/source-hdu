It works in the following way:<br>The original code A is a linear sequence containing N elements. Each element is an integer between 1 and N. At first the code system will generate a permutation B of length N automatically. Compare sequence A and B we can compute a hidden code C by the following rule:<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C295-1002-1.jpg\"></center> <br><br>where, B<sup>-1</sup><sub>1</sub>  stands for the location of integer i in permutation B. For example, if B = {3, 1, 2}, we have B<sup>-1</sup><sub>1</sub>=2,B<sup>-1</sup><sub>3</sub>=1 .<br>The code system has many great advantages in security. For instance, hackers will not have any idea about the original code A if he only gets the hidden code C. Considering all of these, we ordered one of the code systems. <br>However, some awful thing happened yesterday, the boss totally forgot his original code! The boss has the record of his hidden code, and he wants to ask you if it&#x2019;s possible for him to find the original code soon.<br>More exactly, your task is to count the number of possible original codes that may generate the hidden code C by some permutation B.<br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains multiple test cases.<br>In the first line of the input there&#x2019;s an integer T which is the number of test cases. Then the description of T test cases will be given. <br>For each test case there will be two lines. The first line contains one integer N (&#x2264; 30) which is the length of the hidden code C. The second line contains N integers between 1 and N giving C.<br><br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one line containing exactly one integer, the number of different original codes that may generate C.
