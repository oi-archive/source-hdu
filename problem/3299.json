However you do not have the laptop with you, thus you have written the coordinates of all star systems down on a piece of paper and decide to work out the result later. Can you finish this task?<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/con229-1004-1.JPG\"></center>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases in the input file. Each test case starts with one integer N  , (1&lt;=N&lt;=100) , the number of star systems on the telescope. N  lines follow, each line consists of two integers: the X  and Y  coordinates of the K -th planet system. The absolute value of any coordinate is no more than 109 , and you can assume that the planets are arbitrarily distributed in the universe.<br><br>N = 0 indicates the end of input file and should not be processed by your program.
