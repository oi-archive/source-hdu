Addition of two polynomials is achieved by &apos;adding&apos; the coefficients for the corresponding powers in the polynomials. The addition of coefficients is performed by addition modulo 2, i.e., (0 + 0) mod 2 = 0, (0 + 1) mod 2 = 1, (1 + 0) mod 2 = 1, and (1 + 1) mod 2 = 0. Hence, it is the same as the exclusive-or operation. <br><br>(x6 + x4 + x2 + x + 1) + (x7 + x + 1) = x7 + x6 + x4 + x2 <br><br>Subtraction of two polynomials is done similarly. Since subtraction of coefficients is performed by subtraction modulo 2 which is also the exclusive-or operation, subtraction of polynomials is identical to addition of polynomials. <br><br>(x6 + x4 + x2 + x + 1) - (x7 + x + 1) = x7 + x6 + x4 + x2 <br><br>Multiplication of two polynomials is done in the usual way (of course, addition of coefficients is performed by addition modulo 2). <br><br>(x6 + x4 + x2 + x + 1) (x7 + x + 1) <br>= x13 + x11 + x9 + x8 + x6 + x5 + x4 + x3 + 1 <br><br>Multiplication of two polynomials f(x) and g(x) modulo a polynomial h(x) is the remainder of f(x)g(x) divided by h(x). <br><br>(x6 + x4 + x2 + x + 1) (x7 + x + 1) modulo (x8 + x4 + x3 + x + 1) <br>= x7 + x6 + 1 <br><br>The largest exponent of a polynomial is called its degree. For example, the degree of x7 + x6 + 1 is 7. <br><br>Given three polynomials f(x), g(x), and h(x), you are to write a program that computes f(x)g(x) modulo h(x). We assume that the degrees of both f(x) and g(x) are less than the degree of h(x). The degree of a polynomial is less than 1000. <br><br>Since coefficients of a polynomial are 0 or 1, a polynomial can be represented by d+1 and a bit string of length d+1, where d is the degree of the polynomial and the bit string represents the coefficients of the polynomial. For example, x7 + x6 + 1 can be represented by <br><br>8 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1. <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of T test cases.
