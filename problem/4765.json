One day he is asked to deliver packages for customers. There are n customers, where each customer specifies a location to pick up his/her package, and a location to deliver the package. Customers are labeled from 1 to n. For customer i, we denote the pickup location as i+, and the delivery location as i-. To deliver package for customer i, Mo must visit i+ before visiting i-. <br><br> However, the truck Mo drives has only a rear door, so the truck works as a stack: the last picked up package must be delivered first. If there are two packages i and j in the truck, and i is picked up before j, then i cannot be delivered unless j is delivered.<br> <br>Mo knows all the coordinates of pickup and delivery locations. However, due to the censorship of the Great Fire Wall, Mo cannot visit any location more than once. What&apos;s worse, there are additional restrictions:<br> <br>  - Mo can&apos;t go to location j+ from i+ if j &gt; i;<br>  - Mo can&apos;t go to location j- from i- if j &lt; i;<br>  - If Mo has visited location i-, location j+ will be removed from the world and cannot be visited any more if j &lt; i.<br> <br>Now Mo can choose any location to start. He wants to choose a shortest path to deliver packages for all the n customers. Please find the shortest path for him.<br> ","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.<br>For each test case, the first line is an integer n, 0 &lt; n &lt;= 100.<br>Then n lines follow.
