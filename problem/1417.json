Simply put, you must compute the volume of the intersection of anywhere from 2 to 1000 cubes. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input data file consists of several sets of cubes for which the volume of their intersections must be computed. The first line of the data file contains a number (from 2 to 1000) which indicates the number of cubes which follow, one cube per line. Each line which describes a cube contains four integers. The first three integers are the x, y, and z coordinates of the corner of a cube, and the fourth integer is the positive distance which the cube extends in each of the three directions (parallel to the x, y, and z axes) from that corner. <br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Following the data for the first set of cubes will be a number which indicates how many cubes are in a second set, followed by the cube descriptions for the second set, again one per line. Following this will be a third set, and so on. Your program should continue to process sets of cubes, outputting the volume of their intersections to the output file, one set per line, until a zero is read for the number of cubes. <br><br>Note that the data file will always contain at least one set of cubes, and every set will contain at least 2 and at most 1000 cubes. For any given set of cubes, the volume of their intersections will not exceed 1,000,000 units. <br><br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n0 0 0 10\n9 1 1 5\n3\n0 0 0 10\n9 1 1 5\n8 2 2 3\n0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">25\n9</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=ACM%CA%EE%C6%DA%BC%AF%D1%B5%B6%D3%C1%B7%CF%B0%C8%FC%A3%A8%D2%BB%A3%A9&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> ACM&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x6BC;&#xFFFD;&#x475;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x3F0;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x4BB;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
