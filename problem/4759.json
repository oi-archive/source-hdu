He is able to do a perfect shuffle. In a perfect shuffle, the deck containing K cards, where K is an even number, is split into equal halves of K/2 cards which are then pushed together in a certain way so as to make them perfectly interweave. Suppose the order of the cards is (1, 2, 3, 4, &#x2026;, K-3, K-2, K-1, K). After a perfect shuffle, the order of the cards will be (1, 3, &#x2026;, K-3, K-1, 2, 4, &#x2026;, K-2, K) or (2, 4, &#x2026;, K-2, K, 1, 3, &#x2026;, K-3, K-1). <br>Suppose K=2^N and the order of the cards is (1, 2, 3, &#x2026;, K-2, K-1, K) in the beginning, is it possible that the A-th card is X and the B-th card is Y after several perfect shuffles?<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer T indicating the number of datasets.<br>Each case contains five integer, N, A, X, B, Y. 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000, 1 &lt;= A, B, X, Y &lt;= 2^N.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each input case, output &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; if it is possible that the A-th card is X and the B-th card is Y after several perfect shuffles, otherwise &#x201C;No&#x201D;.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n1 1 1 2 2\n2 1 2 4 3\n2 1 1 4 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case 1: Yes\nCase 2: Yes\nCase 3: No</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2013+ACM%2FICPC+Asia+Regional+Changchun+Online&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2013 ACM/ICPC Asia Regional Changchun Online </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
