The two tree has the same size n and index start from 1.<br>As HBB&apos;s son, HNN suddenly realizes that his tree doesn&apos;t look like daddy&apos;s at all. So he can&apos;t stop crying and thinking about how hard the life is. So HBB has to remark son&apos;s tree to make it look like daddy&apos;s tree as much as possible.<br>We define the similarity degree of two tree&apos;s as the number of nodes whose farther has the same id in both tree. Note that root doesn&apos;t has farther node, so it can&apos;t increase the similarity degree.We define the similarity degree of two tree&apos;s as the number of nodes whose farther has the same id in both tree. For example, if node-2&apos;s farther node is node-3 in the first tree, and node-2&apos;s farther node is also node-3 in the second tree, then node-2 is such the kind of node which increase the similarity degree between the two tree.<br>It is a hard work to make HBB and HNN&apos;s similarity degree reach n-1(it is impossible to reach n because the root node), so if HBB can make their similarity degree reach n-3 or more, HNN will stop crying. Is it possible?<br><br><strong>NOTE&#xFF1A;maybe the similarity degree has already reach n-3 or more at the beginning, the answer is true of course</strong><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input gives the number of test cases T; T test cases follow.<br>Each case begins with one line with one integer N: the size of the tree.<br>The next line gives the information of HNN&apos;s tree, the line contains N-1 numbers, the i-th number Pi gives the farther node of the node i+1.<br>The next line gives the information of HBB&apos;s tree, the input way is the same as HNN&apos;s tree.<br><br>Limits<br>$T \\leq 100$<br>$3 \\leq N \\leq 100$<br>$1 \\leq Pi \\leq i$<br>$\\sum N \\leq 6000$","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case output one line denotes the answer.<br>If the similarity can reach n-3, output &quot;YES&quot; , &quot;NO&quot; otherwise.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n5\n1 1 3 3\n1 2 1 4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">YES</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2017+Multi-University+Training+Contest+-+Team+6&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2017 Multi-University Training Contest - Team 6 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
