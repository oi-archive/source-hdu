Therefore, you decide to buy a new computer.<br><br>To make the ideal computer for your needs, you decide to buy separate components and assemble the computer yourself. You need to buy exactly one of each type of component.<br><br>The problem is which components to buy. As you all know, the quality of a computer is equal to the quality of its weakest component. Therefore, you want to maximize the quality of the component with the lowest quality, while not exceeding your budget.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most 100.
