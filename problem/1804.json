Last year Mrs. Deli has decided to expand her business and build up an online store. She has hired a programmer who has implemented the online store. <br><br>Recently some of her new online customers complained about the electronic bills. The programmer had forgotten to use the plural form in case that an item is purchased multiple times. Unfortunaly the programmer of Mrs. Deli is on holiday and now it is your task to implement this feature for Mrs. Deli. Here is a description how to make the plural form: <br><br>1. If the word is in the list of irregular words replace it with the given plural. <br>2. Else if the word ends in a consonant followed by &quot;y&quot;, replace &quot;y&quot; with &quot;ies&quot;. <br>3. Else if the word ends in &quot;o&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;sh&quot; or &quot;x&quot;, append &quot;es&quot; to the word. <br>4.
