The value of K may be different on different shootings. There are N targets to shoot, each target occupy the position of [Li, Ri] , the distance from the starting line is Di(1&lt;=i&lt;=N). Shooting a target can get the bonus points equal to the distance to the starting line. After each shooting targets still exist. Additional, if the previous bonus points is more than P, then as a reward for the shooting present bonus points doubled(and then check the next one).
