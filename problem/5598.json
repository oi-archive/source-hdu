One day, in order to contend for CZF, the young girl of DSY, they decided to have a duel.<br><br>To start with, the two people were given a range, $l,l + 1,l + 2,...,r$, and two numbers, $G$ and $T$. Then, CZF chose either $G$ or $T$ as a number $X$ randomly, and chose an integer $Y$ in the range $[l, r]$ randomly, to perform a special operation, @, which is defined as that X @ Y =((X and Y) or Y) xor X. CZF wanted to know the number of numbers which could be the answer.<br><br>Nevertheless, GTW was not able to tackle this problem. In order to win CZF, he asked for your help.<br><br>Because the answer can be very large, you only need to print the answer modulo 1000000007.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input file contains exactly one integer, $T$, indicating the number of test cases. $(T\\leq 10000)$<br><br>In the following $T$ lines, each line indicates a test case, containing 4 integers, $l, r, g, t$, whose meanings are given above.
