Yuta is worrying about this situation, so he gives Rikka some math tasks to practice. There is one of them:<br><br>A wrestling match will be held tomorrow. $n$ players will take part in it. The $i$th player&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s strength point is $a_i$.<br><br>If there is a match between the $i$th player plays and the $j$th player, the result will be related to $|a_i-a_j|$. If $|a_i-a_j| &gt; K$, the player with the higher strength point will win. Otherwise each player will have a chance to win.<br><br>The competition rules is a little strange. Each time, the referee will choose two players from all remaining players randomly and hold a match between them. The loser will be be eliminated. After $n-1$ matches, the last player will be the winner.<br><br>Now, Yuta shows the numbers $n,K$ and the array $a$ and he wants to know how many players have a chance to win the competition.<br><br>It is too difficult for Rikka.
