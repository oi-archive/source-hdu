Special keywords are used to mark the text to allow control of fonts, page styles, paragraph styles, etc. TeX, troff, and HTML are examples of mark-up languages. <br><br>Spell checking can be difficult to adapt to these special texts. In general, special processors or spell checkers must be created in order to accommodate mark-up languages. A special processor would recognize the mark-up language and strip it from the text so that the ``plain&apos;&apos; text could then be processed by a spell checker. For this problem, you are to write such a processor for a small mark-up language so that the output of your program will be the plain text without the mark-ups. <br><br>The mark-up language to consider is one which allows the modification of fonts within the text. Each markup command will be preceded by a \\ character. If the letter following the \\ character is not a recognized command from the table below then the character following the \\ is printed as part of the plain text. For instance, the mark-up \\\\ can be used to print a single \\. <br><br>   \\b<br>    toggle bold font on/off (default state is off)  <br>   \\i<br>    toggle italics font on/off (default state is off)  <br>   \\s<br>    set font size; the s is immediately followed by an optional number; if the number is missing then the command will restore the previous size  <br>   \\*<br>    toggle processing of mark-ups on/off; if processing is toggle off then mark-ups are considered to be literal text (default state is on)  <br><br>The number following the \\s command can have a decimal point so 12, 9.5, 11., and .5 should all be recognized as valid numbers. <br><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file will be plain text containing mark-ups from the language above.
