It provides various styles of pizzas, hamburgers, sandwiches, coffee, chickens and many other awesome Western cuisines. Welcome to Pizza Hub after this Multi-University Training Contest!<br><br>Since the pizzas are so exquisite, it is never a bad thing to design nice paper pads for them. The pizzas provided in Pizza Hub are sliced into triangles. The rectangular-shaped paper pads are cut from a paper strip of fixed width which is long enough. The pizza should be placed entirely on the pad; however, their borders are allowed to touch. Also, you are allowed to rotate the pizza.<br><br>As the customized paper strip is rather expensive, minimizing the size of the pizza pad can save a lot of money. Can you determine the minimum possible height of the pizza pad, given the width of the paper strip? The following picture illustrates the first sample test case.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C755-1002-1.jpg\"></center>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input is a single integer $T$ $(1 \\leq T \\leq 50000)$, the number of test cases.<br><br>Each test case is a single line of seven integers $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3$ $(0 \\leq x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3 \\leq 10000)$ and $w$ $(1 \\leq w \\leq 10000)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$ and $(x_3, y_3)$ are Cartesian coordinates of the vertices of the pizza, and $w$ is the width of the strip.
