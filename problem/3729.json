There are n students in the class. The students didn&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t want to tell their teacher their exact score; they only told their teacher their rank in the province (in the form of intervals).<br><br>After asking all the students, the teacher found that some students didn&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t tell the truth. For example, Student1 said he was between 5004th and 5005th, Student2 said he was between 5005th and 5006th, Student3 said he was between 5004th and 5006th, Student4 said he was between 5004th and 5006th, too. This situation is obviously impossible. So at least one told a lie. Because the teacher thinks most of his students are honest, he wants to know how many students told the truth at most.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There is an integer in the first line, represents the number of cases (at most 100 cases).
