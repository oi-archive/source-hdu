There is a graph G=(V, E ) with P vertexs and Q bidirectional edges between the vertexs. Sometimes there are a lot of edges between two vertexs, and all the edges differ from each other. V1 is the first vertex and Vp is the last vertex.<br><br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Everytime P player marks a &#x2018;+&#x2019; on one of the remained edges which have neither a &#x2018;+&#x2019; nor &#x2018;-&#x2018; at all, and N player marks a &#x2018;-&#x2018; on that kind of edges without any marks. At the beginning, N player acts first, and then P player does, and then N player does alternately. The game comes to an  end when all the edges are marked with either a &#x2018;+&#x2019; or a &#x2018;-&#x2018;.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Now we give the rules to judge the winner:<br>1)&#xA0;&#xA0;If there exists a road from V1 to Vp, whose edges are all marked with &#x2018;+&#x2019;, P player wins the game ultimately. So we can see, P player tries his best to create a such road to win the game.<br>2)&#xA0;&#xA0;If there exists none such road ,whose edges are all marked with &#x2018;+&#x2019; from V1 to Vp, P player losses the game finally. Also we can see, N player does the best to destory that kind of roads described above in rule(1).<br><br>Now give you such a graph, you need to verdict the result whether the P player can win the game. If true, print &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;, or &#x201C;No&#x201D;.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are T cases.
