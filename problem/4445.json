Laotu is so old that you can only choose a shoot angle(all the angle is available) before game start and then any adjusting is <strong>not allowed</strong>. You need to launch N cannonballs and you know that the i-th cannonball&#x2019;s initial speed is Vi.<br>     On the right side of Laotu There is an enemy tank on the ground with coordination(L1, R1) and a friendly tank with coordination(L2, R2). A cannonball is considered hitting enemy tank if it lands on the ground between [L1,R1] (two ends are included). As the same reason, it will be considered hitting friendly tank if it lands between [L2, R2]. Laotu&apos;s horizontal coordination is 0.<br>     The goal of the game is to maximize the number of cannonballs which hit the enemy tank under the condition that no cannonball hits friendly tank.<br>     The g equals to 9.8.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"     There are multiple test case.<br>     Each test case contains 3 lines.<br>     The first line contains an integer N(0&#x2264;N&#x2264;200), indicating the number of cannonballs to be launched.<br>     The second line contains 5 float number H(1&#x2264;H&#x2264;100000), L1, R1(0&lt;L1&lt;R1&lt;100000) and L2, R2(0&lt;L2&lt;R2&lt;100000).
