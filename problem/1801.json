First of all, the painting tool we speak of supports only black and white. Therefore, a picture consists of a rectangular area of pixels, which are either black or white. Second, there is only one operation how to change the colour of pixels: <br><br>Select a rectangular area of r rows and c columns of pixels, which is completely inside the picture. As a result of the operation, each pixel inside the selected rectangle changes its colour (from black to white, or from white to black). <br><br>Initially, all pixels are white. To create a picture, the operation described above can be applied several times. Can you paint a certain picture which you have in mind?<br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases.
