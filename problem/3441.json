You could see a possible painted board in Figure 2.<br>If one board could be rotated to another board (both painted), we consider them as the same, just as you could see in the figure 3&#x3002;<center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/3441-2.jpg\"></center> Now&#xFF0C;AekdyCoin cut the A*A board into A*A small square boards whose length of side is exactly 1.<center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/3441-3.jpg\"></center><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/3441-4.jpg\"></center>Then AekdyCoin combine some squares to some new B*B squares(as many as possible)&#xFF0C;here :<br>B * B * K + 1 = A * A, (K &gt;= 0)<br>in the figure 5, there are two possible ways, B = 1 or B = 2<br>Then AekdyCoin connect the left one 1 * 1 square to other B * B square(s), as in the figure 6 <center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/3441-5.jpg\"></center> But all the state you get if you rotate any B * B square(s) or rotate the figure around the left one 1 * 1 square are considered as the same. For example, all the states in Figure 7 are same.<center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/3441-6.jpg\"></center> Now AekdyCoin want to know the unique state he could get if he try any possible combination .(That means he will try all possible B)","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is an integer T indicates the number of the cases.
