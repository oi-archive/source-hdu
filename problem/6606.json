One day, zz6d brought n books to a classroom in school. The books of zz6d is so popular that K students in the classroom want to borrow his books to read. Every book of zz6d has a number i (1&lt;=i&lt;=n). Every student in the classroom wants to get a continuous number books. Every book has a pleasure value, which can be 0 or even negative (causing discomfort). Now zz6d needs to distribute these books to K students. The pleasure value of each student is defined as the sum of the pleasure values of all the books he obtains.Zz6d didn&apos;t want his classmates to be too happy, so he wanted to minimize the maximum pleasure of the K classmates. zz6d can hide some last numbered books  and not distribute them,which means he can just split the first x books into k parts and ignore the rest books, every part is consecutive and no two parts intersect with each other.However,every classmate must get at least one book.Now he wonders how small can the maximum pleasure of the K classmates be.<br><br>1&lt;=T&lt;=10  <br>1&lt;=n&lt;=2*$10^5$  <br>1&lt;=k&lt;=n  <br>-$10^9$&lt;=$a_i$&lt;=$10^9$","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Input contains multiple test cases.  <br>The first line of the input is a single integer T which is the number of test cases.
