Now LMY likes to play matrix. LMY designs such a matrix problem. In a large matrix, there are some elements has been marked. For every marked element, return a marked element whose row and column are larger than the original marked element&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s row and column respectively. If there are multiple solutions, return the element whose row is the smallest; and if there are still multiple solutions, return the element whose column is the smallest. If there is no solution, return -1 -1.<br>Of course LMY wants YY also like matrix. So she lets YY develop a program to solve the problem. But YY is very busy now. He should learn English for his enrollment examination for Ph.D. students. Could you help YY develop the program?<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of multiple test cases.
