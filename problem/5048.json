In the red and green light, they will turn yellow. In the red and blue light, they will turn magenta. In the green and blue light, they will turn cyan. In the red, green and blue light, they will turn white.<br><br>   There are M light sources. They can transmit red, green or blue light. But the light they emitted only illuminate a small area.
