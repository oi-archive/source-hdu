The expression consists of operands and operators. <br><br>Each operand consists of one or more vertical toothpicks (&quot;|&quot;); the value of the operand is the number of toothpicks. <br><br>The operators that can appear in an expression are addition and multiplication. The addition operator is the plus sign (&quot;+&quot;), which consists of one vertical and one horizontal toothpick. The multiplication operator is the letter &quot;x&quot;, which also consists of two toothpicks. Multiplication has precedence over addition. <br><br>The expression must begin with an operand. Thereafter, operators and operands alternate. Finally, the expression must end with an operand. Given a positive integer, your program must represent it as a toothpick expression, using the smallest number of toothpicks. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file will consist of one or more lines; each line will contain data for one instance of the problem.

The word &quot;toothpicks&quot; (even if the answer is 1) will be preceded by one blank space and followed by a colon and one blank space. An equal sign (but no blank spaces) will separate the expression from the given number. The expression should not contain any spaces. <br><br>If there are multiple expressions which use the smallest number of toothpicks, any such expression is acceptable. <br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">35\n37\n53</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">14 toothpicks: |||||||x|||||=35\n17 toothpicks: ||||||x||||||+|=37\n21 toothpicks: |||||x|||||x||+|||=53</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=ACM%2FICPC+2008+Warmup%A3%A82%A3%A9%A1%AA%A1%AA%B2%E2%CA%D4%D5%CA%BA%C5%A3%A8%BA%BC%D6%DD%A3%A9&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> ACM/ICPC 2008 Warmup&#xFF08;2&#xFF09;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x6D4B;&#x8BD5;&#x5E10;&#x53F7;&#xFF08;&#x676D;&#x5DDE;&#xFF09; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
