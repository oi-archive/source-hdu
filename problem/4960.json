This morning, his children played with plasticene. They broke the plasticene into N pieces, and put them in a line. Each piece has a volume Vi. Since Xiaoji is an OCD patient, he can&apos;t stand with the disorder of the volume of the N pieces of plasticene. Now he wants to merge some successive pieces so that the volume in line is symmetrical! For example, (10, 20, 20, 10), (4,1,4) and (2) are symmetrical but (3,1,2), (3, 1, 1) and (1, 2, 1, 2) are not.<br><br>   However, because Xiaoji&apos;s OCD is more and more serious, now he has a strange opinion that merging i successive pieces into one will cost ai. And he wants to achieve his goal with minimum cost. Can you help him?<br><br>   By the way, if one piece is merged by Xiaoji, he would not use it to merge again. Don&apos;t ask why. You should know Xiaoji has an OCD.
