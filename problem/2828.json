One lamp may be controlled by several switches, and one switch may controls at most two lamps. And what&#x2019;s more, some connections are reversed by mistake, so it&#x2019;s possible that some lamp is lighted when its corresponding switch is &#x201C;OFF&#x201D;! <br><br>To make things easier, we number all the lamps from 1 to N, and all the switches 1 to M. For each lamps, we give a list of switches controlling it. For example, for Lamp 1, the list is &#x201C;1 ON 3 OFF 9 ON&#x201D;, that means Lamp 1 will be lighted if the Switch 1 is at the &#x201C;ON&#x201D; state OR the Switch 3 is &#x201C;OFF&#x201D; OR the Switch 9 is &#x201C;ON&#x201D;.<br><br>Now you are requested to turn on or off the switches to make all the lamps lighted. <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases in the input.
