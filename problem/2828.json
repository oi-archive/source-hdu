One lamp may be controlled by several switches, and one switch may controls at most two lamps. And what&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s more, some connections are reversed by mistake, so it&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s possible that some lamp is lighted when its corresponding switch is &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;OFF&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;! <br><br>To make things easier, we number all the lamps from 1 to N, and all the switches 1 to M. For each lamps, we give a list of switches controlling it. For example, for Lamp 1, the list is &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;1 ON 3 OFF 9 ON&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, that means Lamp 1 will be lighted if the Switch 1 is at the &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;ON&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; state OR the Switch 3 is &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;OFF&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; OR the Switch 9 is &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;ON&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;.<br><br>Now you are requested to turn on or off the switches to make all the lamps lighted. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases in the input.
