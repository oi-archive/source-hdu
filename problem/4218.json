The distance between any of the points and the center is called the radius.<br>Circles are simple closed curves which divide the plane into two regions: an interior and an exterior. In everyday use, the term &quot;circle&quot; may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure, or to the whole figure including its interior; in strict technical usage, the circle is the former and the latter is called a disk.<br>A circle can be defined as the curve traced out by a point that moves so that its distance from a given point is constant. A circle may also be defined as a special ellipse in which the two foci are coincident and the eccentricity is 0. Circles are conic sections attained when a right circular cone is intersected by a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cone.<br>Now let&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s draw a circle with your program. Given a radius R, we draw a circle in a (2*R + 1) * (2*R + 1) rectangle, set the center of circle at (R, R) (0-based), for all point, if the square root of the difference between the square of its distance to the center and the square of the radius is less than<br>1.732050807568877293527446341505872366942805253810380628055806979451933016908800037081146186757248575675626141415406703029969945094998952478<br>81165551209437364852809323190230558206797482010108467492326501531234326690332288665067225466892183797122704713166036786158801904998653737985<br>9389467650347506576051, draw a star (&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;*&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;), otherwise draw a blank.<br>Refer to the output for more details.
