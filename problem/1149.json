Pascal purports to have &quot;name equivalence&quot;, but it doesn&apos;t; C purports to have structural equivalence, but it doesn&apos;t. Algol 68, the Latin of programming languages, has pure structural equivalence. <br>A simplified syntax for an Algol 68 type definition is as follows: <br><br>   type_def -&gt; type T = type_expr<br>   type_expr -&gt; T | int | real | char | struct ( field_defs )<br>   field_defs -&gt; T | field_defs T<br><br>In this syntax, T is a programmer-defined type name (in this problem, for simplicity, a single upper case letter). Plain text symbols appear literally in the input, and zero or more spaces may appear where there are spaces in the syntax. <br><br>Algol 68 type equivalence say that two types are equivalent if they are the same primitive type or they are both structures containing equivalent types in the same order. <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Input consists of several test cases.

Each type name should appear on exactly one line of output, and the number of output lines should be minimized.
