Each people have a unique message. Some pairs of people can send messages directly to each other, and this relationship forms a structure of a tree. In one turn, exactly one person sends all messages s/he currently has to another person. What is the minimum number of turns needed so that everyone has all the messages? <br>This is not your task. Your task is: count the number of ways that minimizes the number of turns. Two ways are different if there exists some k such that in the k-th turn, the sender or receiver is different in the two ways. <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"First line, number of test cases, T. <br>Following are T test cases. <br>For each test case, the first line is number of people, n.
