Unlike &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;San Guo Sha&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; with its complicated rules, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Liang Guo Sha&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; is a simple game, it consists only four cards, two cards named &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Sha&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, and the other named &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Shan&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;. <br><br>Alice and Bob are good friends, and they&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;re playing &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Liang Guo Sha&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; now. <font color=\"red\">Everyone has two cards: a &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Sha&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; and a &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Shan&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;. </font> Each round, everyone choose a card of his/her own, and show it together(Just show the selected card, do not need to put it away). If both of them choose &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Sha&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;,<b> then Alice gets A points</b>, <font color=\"red\">and Bob loses A points</font>; if both of them choose &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Shan&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, <b>then Alice gets B points</b>,<font color=\"red\"> and Bob loses B points</font>; otherwise, <b>Bob gets C points</b>, <font color=\"red\">and Alice loses C points</font>.&#xA0;&#xA0;<br><br><font color=\"red\">Both Alice and Bob wants to get points as many as possible, they thought a optimal strategy: Calculating a percentage of choosing card &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Sha&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; in order to ensure that even the opponent uses the optimal strategy, he/she can still get a highest point exceptation.</font><br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>Here is the question, if both Alice and Bob use the optimal strategy to make their points higher, what is the expectation point which Alice can get in a round?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Several test case, process to EOF.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Each test case has only a line, consists three positive integers: A, B, C respectively.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;1 &lt;= A, B, C &lt;= 100000","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Each test case just need to output one line, the expectation point that Alice can get.
