Unlike &#x201C;San Guo Sha&#x201D; with its complicated rules, &#x201C;Liang Guo Sha&#x201D; is a simple game, it consists only four cards, two cards named &#x201C;Sha&#x201D;, and the other named &#x201C;Shan&#x201D;. <br><br>Alice and Bob are good friends, and they&#x2019;re playing &#x201C;Liang Guo Sha&#x201D; now. <font color=\"red\">Everyone has two cards: a &#x201C;Sha&#x201D; and a &#x201C;Shan&#x201D;. </font> Each round, everyone choose a card of his/her own, and show it together(Just show the selected card, do not need to put it away).
