All databases are synchronized among all servers and each database has a ordered list denotes the priority of servers to access. This list is guaranteed to be a valid permutation of all servers.<br>Every time someone wants to execute queries on a certain database, he will send a request to the first server in the list. If it&apos;s dead, he will simply turn to the next one. Otherwise a working copy of the database is found, and this copy is called active.<br>Now, given N and M, Makomuno wants to find a permutation for each database which could assure that all servers are load-balanced. Moreover, Makomuno hopes the system will be load-balanced even if <b>exactly</b> one server is broken.<br>Note that if we call the number of active copies on i-th server A<sub>i</sub>, then load-balanced means max&#x2223;A<sub>i</sub> - A<sub>j</sub>&#x2223;&#x2264;1 for any i and j in non broken servers set. We won&apos;t consider broken servers in this case.
