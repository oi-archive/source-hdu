That is, R copies of the first character of S, followed by R copies of the second character of S, and so on. Valid characters for S are the QR Code &quot;alphanumeric&quot; characters:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<center>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z $ % * + - . / : </center>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"    The first line of input contains a single integer P,(1 &lt;= P &lt;= 1000), which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set is a single ling of input consisting of the data set number N, followed by a space, followed by the repeat count R, (1 &lt;= R &lt;= 8), followed by a space , followed by the string S. The length of string S will always be at least one and no more than 20 characters. All the characters will be from the set of characters shown above.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"     For each data set there is one ling of output.
