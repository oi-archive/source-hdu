He found the wall full of color have a post-modern style so he want to have an in-depth research on it.<br><br>To simplify the problem, we divide the wall into n*m (1 &#x2264; n &#x2264; 200, 1 &#x2264; m &#x2264; 50000) pixels, and we have got the order of coming students who drawing on the wall. We found that all students draw four kinds of geometry shapes in total that is Diamond, Circle, Rectangle and Triangle. When a student draw a shape in pixel (i, j) with color c (1 &#x2264; c &#x2264; 9), no matter it is covered before, it will be covered by color c.<br><br>There are q (1 &#x2264; q &#x2264; 50000) students who have make a drawing one by one. And after q operation we want to know the amount of pixels covered by each color.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.<br><br>In the first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, q.
