These constants represent the integers 123, 83 (123 base 8) and 2739 (abc base 16). More precisely, an integer may be a decimal integer given as a sequence of one or more digits less than 10, or it may be an integer to some specific base, given as the base followed by a sequence of one or more digits less than the base enclosed by # symbols. Lower case letters from a through f are used as the digits representing 10 through 15. In Ada, the base, if specified, must be a sequence of decimal digits. For this problem, however, the base may be of any form described above so long as it represents an integer between 2 and 16 inclusive. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a positive integer n. n lines follow<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each line of input, output a line &quot;yes&quot; if it is a valid integer constant according to the above rules; otherwise output a line containing &quot;no&quot;.
