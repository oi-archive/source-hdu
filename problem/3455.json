Both Jack and Jill can jump a maximum horizontal distance of 10 units in any single jump. You are given a list of valid positions x<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>,&#x2026;, x<sub>n</sub> where Jack or Jill may stand. Jill initially starts at position x<sub>1</sub>, Jack initially starts at position x<sub>2</sub>, and their goal is to reach position x<sub>n</sub>.Determine the minimum number of jumps needed until either Jack or Jill reaches the goal. The two players are never allowed to stand at the same position at the same time, and for each jump, the player in the rear must hop over the player in the front.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file will contain multiple test cases.
