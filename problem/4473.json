After scoring so poorly on her maths test, she is faced with the situation that her club would be disband if her scores keeps low.<br>Believe it or not, in the next exam she faces a hard problem described as follows.<br>Let&#x2019;s denote f(x) number of ordered pairs satisfying (a * b)|x (that is, x mod (a * b) = 0) where a and b are positive integers. Given a positive integer n, Rikka is required to solve for f(1) + f(2) + . . . + f(n).<br>According to story development we know that Rikka scores slightly higher than average, meaning she must have solved this problem.
