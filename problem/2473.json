The method used here consists of two steps:<br>1) Extract the common characteristics from the incoming email.<br>2) Use a filter matching the set of common characteristics extracted to determine whether the email is a spam.<br><br>We want to extract the set of common characteristics from the N sample junk emails available at the moment, and thus having a handy data-analyzing tool would be helpful. The tool should support the following kinds of operations:<br><br>a) &#x201C;M X Y&#x201D;, meaning that we think that the characteristics of spam X and Y are the same. Note that the relationship defined here is transitive, so<br>relationships (other than the one between X and Y) need to be created if they are not present at the moment.<br><br>b) &#x201C;S X&#x201D;, meaning that we think spam X had been misidentified. Your tool should remove all relationships that spam X has when this command is received; after that, spam X will become an isolated node in the relationship graph.<br><br>Initially no relationships exist between any pair of the junk emails, so the number of distinct characteristics at that time is N.<br>Please help us keep track of any necessary information to solve our problem.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases in the input file.<br>Each test case starts with two integers, N and M (1 &#x2264; N &#x2264; 10<sup>5</sup> , 1 &#x2264; M &#x2264; 10<sup>6</sup>), the number of email samples and the number of operations.
