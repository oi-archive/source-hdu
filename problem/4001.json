When  we  are  children,  we  are  interesting  in  almost everything around ourselves. A little thing or a simple game will brings us lots of happy time! LLL is a nostalgic boy, now he grows up. In the dead of night, he often misses something, including a simple game which brings him much happy when he was child. Here are the game rules: There lies many blocks on the ground, little LLL wants build &quot;Skyscraper&quot; using these blocks. There are three kinds of blocks signed by an integer d. We describe each block&apos;s shape is Cuboid using four integers ai, bi, ci, di. ai, bi are two edges of the block one of them is length the other is width. ci is <br>thickness of the block. We know that the ci must be vertical with earth ground. di describe the kind of the block. When di = 0 the block&apos;s length and width must be more or equal to the block&apos;s length and width which lies under the block. When di = 1 the block&apos;s length and width must be more  or  equal  to  the  block&apos;s  length  which  lies  under  the  block  and  width  and  the  block&apos;s  area must be more than the block&apos;s area which lies under the block. When di = 2 the block length and width must be more than the block&apos;s length and width which lies under the block. Here are some blocks. Can you know what&apos;s the highest &quot;Skyscraper&quot; can be build using these blocks?
