He has a lot of chains and each chain has n diamonds on it. There are two kinds of diamonds, labeled 0 and 1. We can write down the label of diamonds on a chain. So each chain can be written as a sequence consisting of 0 and 1.<br>We know that chains are different with each other. And their length is exactly n. And what&#x2019;s more, each chain sequence doesn&#x2019;t contain &#x201C;101&#x201D; as a substring. <br>Could you tell how many chains will YaoYao have at most?<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There will be multiple test cases in a test data.
