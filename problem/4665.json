For example, MISSISSIPPI is a shuffle of MISIPP and SSISI. Let me call a string square if it is a shuffle of two identical strings. For example, ABCABDCD is square, because it is a shuffle of ABCD and ABCD, but the string ABCDDCBA is not square. <br>Given a square string, in which each character occurs no more than four times, unshuffle it into two identical strings.
