Each vertex has an initial color with it and the color of $i$-th vertex is $i$. And the vitalness of color $i$ is $w_i$. Initially, all the edges have no color and soda wants to color the edges by using the following operation:<br>    1. choose a vertex $u$ and a color $c$ that vertex $u$ contains<br>    2. choose another vertex $v$ and color all the edges and vertices along the shortest path from $u$ to $v$ with color $c$.<br><br>Note that one color will not cover another color, which means one edge and or vertex can have multiply colors.<br><br>After $m$ such operations, soda computes the vitalness of the tree as follows:<br>    1. for each color $i$, find the total length of edges having color $i$ denoting as $l_i$<br>    2. the vitalness of the tree is $\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{n}l_i \\cdot c_i$<br><br>Help soda find a way to make vitalness of the tree as large as possible after $m$ such operations.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
