Every time, we can apply one of the two following operations:<br>Row flip operation: we can change the color of every grid in a single row.<br>Column swap operation: we can swap two columns (i.e., switch the colors between corresponding grids).<br>The task of the problem is, determine whether it&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s possible to reach the target from the original chessboard by applying the two operations several times. Print &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Yes&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; or &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;No&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; for each case.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases.
