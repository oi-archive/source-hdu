An expression in Smeech may be a positive or negative integer, or may be of the form (p e1 e2) where p is a real number between 0 and 1 (inclusive) and e1 and e2 are Smeech expressions. The value represented by a Smeech expression is as follows: <br>1) An integer represents itself <br>2) With probability p, (p e1 e2) represents x+y where x is the value of e1 and y is the value of e2; otherwise it represents x-y. <br>Given a Smeech expression, what is its expected value?
