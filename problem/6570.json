A series is called &quot;wave&quot; if the following conditions are satisfied:<br>1) It contains at least two elements;<br>2) All elements at odd positions are the same;<br>3) All elements at even positions are the same;<br>4) Elements at odd positions are NOT the same as the elements at even positions.<br>You are given a series with length n. Avin asks you to find the longest &quot;wave&quot; subseries. A subseries is a subsequence of a series.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains two numbers n, c (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; n &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 100, 000, 1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; c &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 100).
