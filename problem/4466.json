Now you decide to cut it into several ordered pieces and fold each piece into a triangle satisfying:<br>*All triangles are integral.<br>* All triangles are pairwise similar.<br>You should count the number of different approaches to form triangles. Two approaches are considered different if either of the following conditions is satisfied:<br>*They produce different numbers of triangles.<br>* There exists i that the i<sup>th</sup> (again, pieces are ordered) triangle in one approaches is not congruent to i<sup>th</sup> triangle in another plan.<br>The following information can be helpful in understanding this problem.<br>* A triangle is integral when all sides are integer.<br>*Two triangles are congruent when all corresponding sides and interior angles are equal.<br>* Two triangles are similar if they have the same shape, but can be different sizes.<br>*For n = 9 you have 6 different approaches to do so, namely<br>(1, 1, 1) (1, 1, 1) (1, 1, 1)<br>(1, 1, 1) (2, 2, 2)<br>(2, 2, 2) (1, 1, 1)<br>(1, 4, 4)<br>(2, 3, 4)<br>(3, 3, 3)<br>where (a, b, c) represents a triangle with three sides a, b, c.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases.<br>For each test case there is a single line containing one integer n (1 &#x2264; n &#x2264; 5 * 10<sup>6</sup>).<br>Input is terminated by EOF.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one line &#x201C;Case X: Y&#x201D; where X is the test case number (starting from 1) and Y is the number of approaches, moduled by 10<sup>9</sup> + 7.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n15\n19\n20\n100\n1000</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case 1: 0\nCase 2: 0\nCase 3: 1\nCase 4: 0\nCase 5: 1\nCase 6: 2\nCase 7: 1\nCase 8: 6\nCase 9: 3\nCase 10: 4\nCase 11: 10\nCase 12: 25\nCase 13: 10\nCase 14: 16\nCase 15: 525236\nCase 16: 523080925</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2012+Asia+Chengdu+Regional+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2012 Asia Chengdu Regional Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
