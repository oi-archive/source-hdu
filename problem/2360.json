An example of such a ladder (usually arranged vertically, hence the &quot;ladder&quot; would be: beer, brew, brow, word, down. Note that to get from one word to the next, the letters may be rearranged, and exactly one letter is changed.<br> For this problem, you will be given a dictionary of distinct words, all of the same length. Your task is to write a program that finds a word ladder of minimal length, such that the first and last word of the ladder have no letters in common.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"On the first line an integer t (1&lt;=t &lt;= 100): the number of test cases.
