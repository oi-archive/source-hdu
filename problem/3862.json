One day, he decided to go out for a travel. There are two kinds of traveling ways for Bob: to walk forward, and to rotate. When he searched the path with his iPhone 4, he only downloaded part of the data because of the bad signal. The data just indicated a series of directions for rotation. Bob decided to go on his trip according to this data.<br><br>Bob got started at the center of the two-dimensional world (at least he thought he did), and began to move forward. He can walk far enough (but he can&apos;t stay at the same place, even in starting point) and then stop to rotate according to the data. The paths can get intersected.<br><br>However, Bob didn&apos;t know whether he could get back home or not. So he turned to you for help.<br><br>For example, the data indicates like this:<br>Move forward (He must move for a distance greater than zero. He must not stay and make the next turning without moving forward.  The same goes for the following.)<br>Turn 120 degrees anti-clockwise<br>Move forward<br>Turn 120 degrees clockwise<br>Move forward<br>Turn 120 degrees clockwise<br>Move forward<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>Bob could walk like the figure shows, and he&apos;ll get back home.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C352-1004-1.jpg\"></center> ","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T.
