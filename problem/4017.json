He wants to move to another position of the cylinder&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s surface. Like many other animals named Smart, he wants to find out the shortest path from one point to another.<br>Unfortunately, Ant Smart is not enough smart to solve this question now. It is your task to find out the answer.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases in this problem. The first line of input contains a single integer denoting the number of test cases.<br>For each test case, the first line contains two integers: radius and height (1&lt;=radius&lt;=100, 1&lt;=height&lt;=100), denoting the radius and height of the cylinder.<br>For the next two lines, each line contains three integers: h, a and r (0 &lt;= h &lt;= height, 0 &lt;= a &lt; 360, 0 &lt;= r &lt;= radius), denoting one point on the surface of cylinder each. The h indicates a circle on the surface of cylinder which apart h from the bottom. And the polar angle a and radius r indicates the position of the point on the circle. In the other words, if the cylinder is (0,0,0) - (0,0,height) on the 3D grid coordinate. The point can be represented as (cos(a)*r, sin(a)*r, h).<br>You may assume that r!=radius only when h=0 or h=height for each point.<br><br>Warning: There are about one thousand test cases. Be careful with the time efficiency.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output only one line contains the length of the shortest path on the surface of cylinder.
