In this project, they need to access some information on a website and monitor this web site for consistent $t$ days. In others words, in each day, there must be at least one server in work. Luckily, they can rent some servers in the lab. According to the schedule, there are totally $N$ servers being available. The $i$-th server can be used from the $S_i$-th day to the $T_i$-th day. However, using the $i$-th server require $A_i$ dollars. After a long time of persuasion, the administrator of the machine room agree to give Alice and Bob discount. Each server is assigned with a discount number $B_i$. If the set of servers they want to use is $S$,  they need to pay $\\frac{\\sum_{i\\in S}A_i}{\\sum_{i\\in S}B_i}$ dollars. As Alice and Bob are preparing the programs on the servers, they want your help to find a way to minimize the cost of servers.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is the number of test cases.
