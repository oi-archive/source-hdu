So  the  government decides to send some workers to repair these locations. There are m kinds of workers that were trained for different skills. Each location need some number of some kinds of workers and has a schedule that at what time can the repair begins, and the time cost of repair. Any job cannot begin until all the workers required arrived.  <br>For  example,  location  1 needs  2  workers  of type  1  and  3  workers  of type  2,  and  the beginning time and time cost is 100 minute and 90 minute correspondingly, then 5 workers that  satisfy the  requirement should  arrive  before 100 minute,  start  working  at  100 minute and  get  the  job  done  at  190  minute. Notice  that  two  different  types  of  workers  cannot replace  each  other,  so  with  3  workers  of  type  1  and  only  2  workers  of  type  2,  this  job cannot be done. <br>Workers  can go from  one  location  to  another  after  their  jobs  are  done.  You  can take the Euclidean  distance  between  locations  as  the  time  workers  need  to  travel  between them.  Each worker should be sent from a depot initially at 0 minute. Now your task is to determine  the  minimum  number  of  workers  needed to  be  sent  from  depot  so  that  all  the jobs can be done.
