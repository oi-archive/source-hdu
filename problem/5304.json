But Rikka wants Kumin to play games with her. So she comes up with one problem:<br><br>Here is an undirected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Now you need to delete $m-n$ edges and to make sure that the remain graph is connected. Rikka wants you to tell her the number of ways to choose the edges.<br><br>Kumin wants to go to sleep, so she asks you to answer this question. Can you help her?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are at most 100 testcases&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;and there are no more 5 testcases with $n \\geq 10$. <br><br>For each test case, the first line contains two integers $n,  m\\ (1 \\leq n \\leq 16, n \\leq m \\leq \\frac{n(n-1)}{2})$.<br><br>Then $m$ lines follows. Each of them contains two integers $u_i,v_i$, meaning that there is an edge between $u_i$ and $v_i$.
