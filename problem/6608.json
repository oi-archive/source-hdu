Module P.But he is too busy to find out the answer. So he ask you for help. ( Q! is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n: n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) *&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; * 3 * 2 * 1 . For example, 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 )<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"First line contains an number T(1&lt;=T&lt;=10) indicating the number of testcases.<br>Then T line follows, each contains a positive prime number P (1e9&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;p&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;1e14)<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each testcase, output an integer representing the factorial of Q modulo P.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n1000000007</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">328400734</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2019+Multi-University+Training+Contest+3&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2019 Multi-University Training Contest 3 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
