There are 4 different contiguous $2 \\times 2$ subsquares in a magic squares, which are labeled from 1 to 4 as the following figure shows. These $2 \\times 2$ subsquares can be rotated. We use the label of the subsquare with an uppercase letter to represent a rotation. If we rotate the subsquare clockwise, the letter is &apos;C&apos;; if we rotate it counterclockwise, the letter is &apos;R&apos;. The following figure shows two different rotations.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C755-1005-1.jpg\"></center><br><br>Now, given the initial state of a magic square and a sequence of rotations, please print the final state of the magic square after these rotations are performed.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input is a single integer $T$ $(1 \\leq T \\leq 100)$, the number of test cases.<br><br>Each test case begins with a single integer $n$ $(1 \\leq n \\leq 100)$, the number of rotations.
