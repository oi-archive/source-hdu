Unfortunately, despite Peter&#x2019;s affluence, he is not able to invite all of his friends due to the astronomical price of the air ticket to Stockholm.<br>He has devised the following rule to determine which subset of his friends will be invited:<br>a) Any invited person must have at least A acquaintances at the party. This is to ensure everyone at the party will not feel alien.<br>b) Any invited person must be unfamiliar with at least B people. Otherwise some people may not have the chance to communicate with a stranger.<br>Given the relationships between Peter&#x2019;s friends, you are to figure out whom Peter should invite to the party so as to maximize its size.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases in the input file.<br>Each test case starts with four integers, N, M, A, and B ( 1 &#x2264; N &#x2264; 100 , 0 &#x2264; M &#x2264; N*(n-1)/2 , 0 &#x2264; A , B &#x2264; N - 1). Each of the following M lines contains<br>two integers, X and Y, ( 0 &#x2264; X,Y &#x2264; N-1 , X&#x2260;Y), indicating that friend X and friend Y are acquaintances.<br>Two successive test cases are separated by a blank line.
