Some fragments can be selected into the map directly (named 1-level fragments), while each of the rest follows <b>exactly one</b> fragment as its prior fragment. If B follows A and A is an i-level fragment, then B is defined as an (i + 1) - level fragment, and B can be selected only if A has been selected before. Besides, a fragment is followed by at most one other fragment.<br><br>   Each fragment is assigned with a reliability. The reliability of the whole map is sum up by two parts:<br>   1.The sum of reliabilities of all selected fragments;<br>   2.If there are x<sub>i</sub> i-level fragments in total and we select y<sub>i</sub>(y<sub>i</sub> &gt; 1) fragments among them to form the map, the reliability would increase by <img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C507-1001-1.jpg\">,where S<sub>i</sub> denotes the sum of reliabilities of selected fragments in level i.<br><br>   Please figure out the expectation of reliability of the map under the condition that all valid selections are equiprobable.<br><br>   At least one fragment should be selected.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   There are several test cases.
