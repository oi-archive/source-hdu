But to his disappointed, the more he played, the more he lost. Tom soon gave up the game. <br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/3502-1.jpg\"></center> <br><br>Now, he invents an easier game on the base of &#x201C;Hudson&apos;s Adventure Island&#x201D;. He wants to know whether the new game is easy enough. So he came to you for help. <br>To simplify the problem, you can assume there is matrix-map contains m(0 &lt; m &lt; 256) rows, n(0 &lt; n &lt; 256) columns, an entrance on the top-left corner (0, 0), an exit on the bottom-right corner (m-1, n-1). Each entry of the matrix contains a integer k.The range of k is defined below:<br>    a)k = 0,it is a free space one can go through.<br>    b)k = -1,it is an obstacle one can&#x2019;t go through.<br>    c)0 &lt; k &lt; 10000,it is a fruit one can go through and gain k points of energy.<br>    d)k &gt;= 0 at the entrance point and the end point.<br>At the begin, the hero has 0 points of energy and he can go four directions (up, down, left, right). Each move he makes cost 1 point of energy. No energy no move. If he can&#x2019;t make a move or get to the exit, he loses the game. The number of fruit is 17 at most.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of multiple test cases.
