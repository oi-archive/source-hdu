There are links in the network that connect pairs of nodes. A pair of nodes may have multiple links between them, but no node has a link to itself.  A link can only transmit in a single direction.<br><br>For two nodes $x$ and $y$, if both $x$ and $y$ can transmit to each other (perhaps through some intermediate nodes), then $x$ and $y$ are in the same group.<br><br>soda wants to increase the number of groups in the network by deleting a link.
