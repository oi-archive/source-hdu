There are some machines. Each two overlapping schedules cannot be performed in the same machine. For each machine the working time is defined as the difference between $time_{end}$ and $time_{start}$ , where time_{end} is time to turn off the machine and $time_{start}$ is time to turn on the machine. We assume that the machine cannot be turned off between the $time_{start}$ and the $time_{end}$. <br>Print the minimum number K of the machines for performing all schedules, and when only uses K machines, print the minimum sum of all working times.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer T (1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100), the number of test cases.
