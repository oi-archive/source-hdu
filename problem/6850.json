The rule is as follows:<br><br>- Before the game start, The stone is at the first point.<br>- Dodo and ddd move the stone in turn, Dodo moves first.<br>- In the first move, the player can move the stone to any point except the first point. <br>- Starting from the second move, assume the stone is currently at point $x$, and the distance of the stone traveled in the last move is $d$. The player can move the stone to a point $y$ if and only if $\\text{distance(x,y)} &gt; d$ and point $y$ has never been visited before.<br>- If a player cannot make a move, he loses the game.<br><br>Please determine who will win the game if both player use the best strategy.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer $T(1 \\leq T \\leq 100)$, indicating the number of test cases.<br><br>Each test case contains several lines.
