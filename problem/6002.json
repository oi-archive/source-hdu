The game contains a social network, so players can make friends with each other. The friend relation is symmetric, which means if A is a friend of B, B is also a friend of A.<br>Players&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; ratings are distinct from each other, which means there are no two players sharing a same rating. Each player owns a ranklist containing all his friends&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; rating (including himself) and there is one leader who has the highest rating in each player&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s ranklist.<br>Tom has N friends. During the communications with these friends, he knows some pairs of friends are also friends. But he doesn&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t know all the such pairs. In other words, some friends maybe are friends but Tom doesn&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t know it.<br>One day, Tom noticed that the system started showing the number of leaders for every friend.<br>E.g. the system may says Peter is leader on 3 players&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; ranklist.<br>Now Tom can see the number of leaders for every friend. He would like to know the least number of strangers&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; ranklist leader are his friends.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case starts with a line consists of 3 integers, N, M and R representing the number of people on Tom&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s ranklist(including Tom), the number of friendships Tom knows and the rank of Tom in his ranklist(1-indexed). The next line consists of N integers, the $i^{th}$ integer $C_i$ represents the number of leaders for the friend on rank i. The following M lines each consists of 2 integers $X_i$ , $Y_i$ , means that the friend on rank $X_i$ is a friend of friend on rank $Y_i$.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one line containing &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Case #x: y&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the least number of ranklists that not owned by Tom&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s friend but the leader is Tom&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s friend.<br><h2>limits</h2><br>$\\bullet 1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; T &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 100.$<br>$\\bullet 1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N, M &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 10^5.$<br>$\\bullet 1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; X_i &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N.$<br>$\\bullet 1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; Y_i &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N.$<br>$\\bullet 1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; R &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N.$<br>$\\bullet R \\neq X_i .$<br>$\\bullet R \\neq Y_i .$<br>$\\bullet X_i \\neq Y_i .$<br>$\\bullet 0 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; C_i &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 10^9.$<br>$\\bullet$ It&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s guaranteed that the data is valid.<br><br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n4 0 3\n1 0 0 2\n4 1 4\n1 0 2 0\n1 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 2\nCase #2: 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2016+CCPC-Final&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2016 CCPC-Final </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
