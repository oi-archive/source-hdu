The game contains a social network, so players can make friends with each other. The friend relation is symmetric, which means if A is a friend of B, B is also a friend of A.<br>Players&#x2019; ratings are distinct from each other, which means there are no two players sharing a same rating. Each player owns a ranklist containing all his friends&#x2019; rating (including himself) and there is one leader who has the highest rating in each player&#x2019;s ranklist.<br>Tom has N friends. During the communications with these friends, he knows some pairs of friends are also friends. But he doesn&#x2019;t know all the such pairs. In other words, some friends maybe are friends but Tom doesn&#x2019;t know it.<br>One day, Tom noticed that the system started showing the number of leaders for every friend.<br>E.g. the system may says Peter is leader on 3 players&#x2019; ranklist.<br>Now Tom can see the number of leaders for every friend. He would like to know the least number of strangers&#x2019; ranklist leader are his friends.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case starts with a line consists of 3 integers, N, M and R representing the number of people on Tom&#x2019;s ranklist(including Tom), the number of friendships Tom knows and the rank of Tom in his ranklist(1-indexed). The next line consists of N integers, the $i^{th}$ integer $C_i$ represents the number of leaders for the friend on rank i.
