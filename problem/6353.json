Every morning Noah would like to pick two vertices $u$ and $v$ to get influence from daylight and then the influence spreads through edges, but the influence will be disappeared if it has passed through more than $w$ edges.<br>Your task is to calculate the number of vertices influenced by the daylight for each day. In addition, input data will be encrypted to make sure your solution is online.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains one integer $T$, indicating the number of test cases.<br>The following lines describe all the test cases.
