It can be defined more formally as the number of integers $k$ in the range $1\\leq k\\leq n$ for which the greatest common divisor $\\gcd(n, k)$ is equal to $1$.<br>For example, $\\varphi(9) = 6$ because $1, 2, 4, 5, 7$ and $8$ are coprime with $9$. As another example, $\\varphi(1) = 1$ since for $n = 1$ the only integer in the range from $1$ to $n$ is $1$ itself, and $\\gcd(1, 1) = 1$.<br>A composite number is a positive integer that can be formed by multiplying together two smaller positive integers. Equivalently, it is a positive integer that has at least one divisor other than $1$ and itself. So obviously $1$ and all prime numbers are not composite number.<br>In this problem, given integer $k$, your task is to find the $k$-th smallest positive integer $n$, that $\\varphi(n)$ is a composite number.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T(1\\leq T\\leq100000)$, denoting the number of test cases.<br>In each test case, there is only one integer $k(1\\leq k\\leq 10^9)$.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print a single line containing an integer, denoting the answer.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n1\n2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5\n7</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2018+Multi-University+Training+Contest+3&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2018 Multi-University Training Contest 3 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
