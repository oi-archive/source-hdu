He wants to build a new house close to his customers, so he doesn&apos;t have to travel as much any more. Luckily John knows the location of all of his customers.<br>All of the customers&apos;  locations are at (distinct) integer coordinates. John&apos;s new house should also be built on integer coordinates, which cannot be the same as any of the customers&apos; locations. Since John lives in a large and crowded city, the travelling distance to any customer is the Manhattan distance: |x - x<sub>i</sub>| + |y - y<sub>i</sub>|, where (x, y) and (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) are the coordinates of the new house and a customer respectively.<br>What is the number of locations where John could settle, so the sum of the distance to all of his customers is as low as posible?<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"On the first line an integer t (1 &lt;= t &lt;= 100): the number of test cases.
