People always fight for the biggest source of water. Given a sequence of water sources with $a_1, a_2, a_3, . . . , a_n$ representing the size of the water source. Given a set of queries each containing $2$ integers $l$ and $r$, please find out the biggest water source between $a_l$ and $a_r$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"First you are given an integer $T (T \\leq 10)$ indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, there is a number $n (0 \\leq n \\leq 1000)$ on a line representing the number of water sources. $n$ integers follow, respectively $a_1, a_2, a_3, . . . , a_n$, and each integer is in $\\{1, . . . , 10^6\\}$.  On the next line, there is a number $q (0 \\leq q \\leq 1000)$ representing the number of queries. After that, there will be $q$ lines with two integers $l$ and $r (1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n)$ indicating the range of which you should find out the biggest water source.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each query, output an integer representing the size of the biggest water source.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n1\n100\n1\n1 1\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n5\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n3 4\n3 5\n3\n1 999999 1\n4\n1 1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">100\n2\n3\n4\n4\n5\n1\n999999\n999999\n1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2015+ACM%2FICPC+Asia+Regional+Changchun+Online&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2015 ACM/ICPC Asia Regional Changchun Online </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
