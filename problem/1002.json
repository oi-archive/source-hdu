Then T lines follow, each line consists of two positive integers, A and B. Notice that the integers are very large, that means you should not process them by using 32-bit integer. You may assume the length of each integer will not exceed 1000.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, you should output two lines. The first line is &quot;Case #:&quot;, # means the number of the test case. The second line is the an equation &quot;A + B = Sum&quot;, Sum means the result of A + B. Note there are some spaces int the equation.
