So he develops a special text editor.The text editor is so special that it only supports 3 special operation: &quot;Reverse&quot;,&quot;Shift&quot; and &quot;Query&quot;.<br><br>1.The &quot;Reverse&quot; command has 2 parameters A and B.<br>The format is &quot;R A B&quot;. After the command executed, the editor will reverse the substring which is in the string from position A to position B.<br><br>2.The &quot;Shift&quot; command also has 2 parameters A and B.<br>The format is &quot;S A B&quot;. After the command executed, the editor will translate every character in the substring which is in the string from positon A to position B to the NEXT character in alphabetic table.In another word, it will translate &apos;a&apos; to &apos;b&apos;,&apos;b&apos; to &apos;c&apos; ... &apos;y&apos; to &apos;z&apos;. Specially it will translate &apos;z&apos; to &apos;a&apos;.<br><br>3.The &quot;Query&quot; command has only 1 parameter A.<br>The format is &quot;Q A&quot;. When the text editor receives the command,it just reports the character which is in the postion A of the string now.<br><br><br>For example, let&apos;s consider the string &quot;abcdefzh&quot; whose length is 8.<br>After we operate the  command &quot;R 2 7&quot;, the string will be &quot;azfedcbh&quot;.<br>Then after we operate the command &quot;S 2 3&quot;, it will be &quot;aagedcbh&quot;.<br><br>Now your task is to simulate the process, and output the exact character when you read a &quot;Query&quot; command. Is that easy ?  Just come and AC it !","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer T which means the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.<br>In the first line there are two integers N(0&lt;N&lt;=80000) and C(0&lt;C&lt;=3000) which indicate  the length of the string and the number of the commands.<br>In the second line there is a string whose length is N and which is only consisted of lowercase letters.<br>Then C lines follow. Each line describes a command in the form of &apos;Q A&apos; or &apos;R A B&apos; or &apos;S A B&apos; (0&lt;A&lt;=B&lt;=N).","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each &quot;Query&quot; command, output the character which the text editor reports.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n8 5\nabcdefzh\nQ 4\nR 2 7\nQ 3\nS 2 3\nQ 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">d\nf\na</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Author","content":"linle","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2008%BA%BC%B5%E7%BC%AF%D1%B5%B6%D3%D1%A1%B0%CE%C8%FC&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2008&#x676D;&#x7535;&#x96C6;&#x8BAD;&#x961F;&#x9009;&#x62D4;&#x8D5B; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
