She starts with a bottle that contains N pills.<br><br>On the first day, she removes a random pill, breaks it in two halves, takes one half and puts the other half back into the bottle.<br><br>On subsequent days, she removes a random piece (which can be either a whole pill or half a pill) from the bottle. If it is half a pill, she takes it. If it is a whole pill, she takes one half and puts the other half back into the bottle.<br><br>In how many ways can she empty the bottle? We represent the sequence of pills removed from the bottle in the course of 2N days as a string, where the i-th character is W if a whole pill was chosen on the i-th day, and H if a half pill was chosen (0 &lt;= i &lt; 2N). How many different valid strings are there that empty the bottle?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input will contain data for at most 1000 problem instances.
