What make things worse, many bitter potatoes lives in these mountains. They hate sweet potato because they don&apos;t have girl friends.<br><br>In the world of potatoes, friction force does not exist. So the way potatoes travel is very simple: they start with an initial speed, rolling forward and waiting to get to the destination. <br><br>Bitter potatoes lived in different places. When sweet potato rolls passing their home, they begin to chase him (surely by rolling with an initial speed). If sweet potato is caught by a bitter potato, his date with girl friend has to be canceled.<br><br>Now sweet potato wants to know the minimum initial speed necessary to see his girl friend.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C364-1006-1.jpg\"></center>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"First line is an integer T (T &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 50), the number of test cases.<br><br>At the beginning of each case is three integers, N, M and w, indicate the number of peaks in the mountains, the number of bitter potatoes and the weight of sweet potato separately.<br><br>2 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 1000, 0 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; M &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 1000, 0 &lt; w &lt; 100000.<br><br>The next N lines each contain a pair of integers.
