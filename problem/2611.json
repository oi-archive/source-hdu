When you want to solve a problem by using the search method, try to cut is very important.<br>Now give you a number sequence, include n (&lt;=100) integers, each integer not bigger than 2^31, you want to find the first P subsequences that is not decrease (if total subsequence W is smaller than P, than just give the first W subsequences). The order of subsequences is that: first order the length of the subsequence. Second order the subsequence by lexicographical. For example initial sequence 1 3 2 the total legal subsequences is 5. According to order is {1}; {2}; {3}; {1,2}; {1,3}. If you also can not understand , please see the sample carefully. <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains multiple test cases.<br>Each test case include, first two integers n, P.
