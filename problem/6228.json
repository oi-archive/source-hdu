If you cannot understand the concept of a tree here, please omit this problem.<br>Now we decide to colour its nodes with k distinct colours, labelled from 1 to k. Then for each colour i = 1, 2, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; , k, define Ei as the minimum subset of edges connecting all nodes coloured by i. If there is no node of the tree coloured by a specified colour i, Ei will be empty.<br>Try to decide a colour scheme to maximize the size of E1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; E2 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; Ek, and output its size.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains an integer T (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; T &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 1000), indicating the total number of test cases.<br>For each case, the first line contains two positive integers n which is the size of the tree and k (k &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 500) which is the number of colours.
