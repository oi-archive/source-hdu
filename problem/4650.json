The interconnected objects are represented by mathematical abstractions called vertices, and the links that connect some pairs of vertices are called edges. A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices, and for any 2 adjacent u, v, there is a edge from u to v in graph. A path contains at least one edge. In the graph in Sample 2, {3, 3, 2, 2} can form a path from 3 to 2. <br><br>One of the common problem is to find the shortest path between two certain vertices, or all of them. They&apos;ve been well studied as the single source shortest path problem (SSSP) and the all pairs shortest paths problem (APSP).<br><br>In this problem, we&apos;ll provide you a derivation analogous to APSP. You&apos;ve been given a directed graph with positive or negative edge weights. We define the average weight of a path, as the sum of the edge weights divide the edges number of path. Now you need to find the minimum average weight between all pairs of vertices (APMAWP). <br><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Muiltcases.
