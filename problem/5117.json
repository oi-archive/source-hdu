Matt finds that there are N fluorescent lights which seem to be the stars from the firmament. What&#x2019;s more, there are M switches that control these fluorescent lights. Each switch is connected to a group of lights. When Matt touches a switch, all the lights connected to it will change their states (turning the dark on, turning the bright off).<br><br>   Initially, all the fluorescent lights are dark. For each switch, Matt will touch it with probability 1 .<br><br>   As a curious gentleman, Matt wants to calculate E[X3], where X represents the number of bright lights at the end, E[X3] represents the expectation of cube of X.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The first line contains only one integer T , which indicates the number of test cases.<br><br>   For each test case, the first line contains N, M (1 &#x2264; N, M &#x2264; 50), denoting the number of fluorescent lights (numbered from 1 to N ) and the number of switches (numbered from 1 to M ).<br><br>   M lines follow.
