In this game, there are $n$ unknown numbers $x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n$ and $m$ NPCs selling hints. The $i$-th NPC is selling $c_i$ hints. Each hint contains three integers $l_j,r_j,w_j$, which means Calabash can pay $w_j$ coins to buy this hint, and this hint can tell Calabash the value of $x_{l_j}+x_{l_j+1}+\\dots+x_{r_j-1}+x_{r_j}$.<br><br>The target of the game is to figure out all the $n$ unknown numbers. Clever Calabash knows how to buy hints optimally, but NPCs are greedy, for the $i$-th NPC, Calabash must buy exactly $k_i$ hints from him. Note that each hint can&apos;t be bought more than once.<br><br>This problem is much more difficult for Calabash. Please write a program to help Calabash find the cheapest way, or determine it is impossible.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T(1\\leq T\\leq 10)$, denoting the number of test cases.<br><br>In each test case, there are two integers $n,m(1\\leq n,m\\leq 80)$ in the first line, denoting the number of unknown numbers and NPCs.<br><br>For the next $m$ parts, there are two integers $c_i,k_i(1\\leq k_i\\leq c_i)$ in the first line, denoting the number of hints the $i$-th NPC has and the limit for the $i$-th NPC.<br><br>For the next $c_i$ lines, each line contains three integers $l_j,r_j,w_j(1\\leq l_j\\leq r_j\\leq n,1\\leq w_j\\leq 10^6)$, describing each hint offered by the $i$-th NPC.<br><br>It is guaranteed that $\\sum c_i\\leq 80$ in each test case.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print a single line containing an integer, denoting the minimum number of coins.
