A lot of popular musicians are invited to join us in the music festival. Each of them will play one of their representative songs.

More specifically, given a theme section E, the song will be in the format of &apos;EAEBE&apos;, where section A and section B could have arbitrary number of notes. Note that there are 26 types of notes, denoted by lower case letters &apos;a&apos; - &apos;z&apos;.<br><br>To get well prepared for the festival, the hosts want to know the maximum possible length of the theme section of each song.
