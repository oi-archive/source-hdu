First of all, the only characters used are the space and lower case English letters. Each character is assigned an integer called the character volume, a space character has volume 1, &#x2018;a&#x2019; has volume 2, &#x2018;b&#x2019; has volume 3 and so on until &#x2018;z&#x2019; which has volume 27. The volume of the whole message V is the sum of volumes of characters in the message.<br>2. A message consists of a number of words W, a word is a consecutive sequence of lower case letters, messages have no leading or trailing spaces and there is only one space between consecutive words.<br>3. For a certain V and W, let S be the lexicographically sorted set of messages that have volume V and consists of exactly W words. We can refer to a certain message using its one-based index I in S.<br>So when the spy wants to send a message M, he calculates its Volume V and the number of words it contains W and finds its index I in the corresponding set S (its index among all sorted messages of volume V with W words) and sends only  three numbers along: V, W and I!<br>The Department of National Security has done a great effort so far, yet they seek your help to decode messages sent by the spy! That is, given V, W and I you must decrypt the spy&#x2019;s message or determine that there is no such one!","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains an integer (1 &lt;= T &lt;= 200), the number of test cases.<br>Each data set consists of a line with three integers the volume of the message (1 &lt;= V &lt;= 75), the number of words (1 &lt;= W &lt;= 20), and the index of message (1 &lt;= I &lt;= 10<sup>18</sup>).","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print one line containing the decrypted message or &#x201C;Corrupted!&#x201D; if there is no valid message corresponding to the given inputs.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n7 2 3\n2 1 2\n50 2 39098532022</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: aa a\nCase #2: Corrupted!\nCase #3: big bang\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nIn the first test case, the sorted set of messages of volume 7 which contain 2 words is {&#x201C;a aa&#x201D;, &#x201C;a c&#x201D;, &#x201C;aa a&#x201D;,\n&#x201C;b b&#x201D;, &#x201C;c a&#x201D;}, hence the third and required message is &#x201C;aa a&#x201D;.\nIn the second test case, the sorted set of messages of volume 2 which contain 1 word is {&#x201C;a&#x201D;}, the set has\nonly one message while index 2 is required, so something must have gone wrong!\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=The+Third+Lebanese+Collegiate+Programming+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> The Third Lebanese Collegiate Programming Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
