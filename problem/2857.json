Giving you the position of mirror and the two points the light goes in before and after the reflection, calculate the reflection point of the light on the mirror.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>You can assume the mirror is a straight line and the given two points can&#x2019;t be on the different sizes of the mirror.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is the number of test case t(t&lt;=100).<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>The following every four lines are as follow:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;X1 Y1<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;X2 Y2<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Xs Ys<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Xe Ye<br><br>&#xA0;&#xA0;(X1,Y1),(X2,Y2) mean the different points on the mirror, and (Xs,Ys) means the point the light travel in before the reflection, and (Xe,Ye) is the point the light go after the reflection.<br><br>&#xA0;&#xA0;The eight real number all are rounded to three digits after the decimal point, and the absolute values are no larger than 10000.0.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"&#xA0;&#xA0;Each lines have two real number, rounded to three digits after the decimal point, representing the position of the reflection point.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n0.000 0.000\n4.000 0.000\n1.000 1.000\n3.000 1.000</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2.000 0.000 </div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2009+Multi-University+Training+Contest+5+-+Host+by+NUDT&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2009 Multi-University Training Contest 5 - Host by NUDT </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
