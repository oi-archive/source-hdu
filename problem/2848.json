Now I will introduce it to you, my friend.<br><br>At the beginning of the game, a machine will generate two numbers, N(10 &lt; N &lt; 10 ^ 19) and K(2 &lt;= K &lt;= length(N)). Then boyA and boyB are take turns to play it:<br><br>When one player receives two numbers N and K, his task is to cut N into K nonempty pieces. If length(N) &lt; K, that is to say he can not able to cut, he loses the game. Otherwise, he adds these K pieces together and get the sum SUM. Then let N = SUM and throw N and K to another player.<br><br>We assume boyA receives the two numbers from the machine firstly and they are smart enough to choose the best strategy for himself.<br>Now please help boyA to calculate weather he can win if he receives N and K firstly.<br><br>Here is a sample for you N = 103, K = 2.<br>Fisrtly, boyA receives N = 103, K = 2. He has two ways to cut like: 1|03 =&gt; 1 + 03 = 4, or 10|3 =&gt; 10 + 3 = 13.<br>Then, boyB receives from boyA. If boyB receives N = 4, K = 2, he loses the game. If boyB receives N = 13 and K = 2, he has only one way to cut: 1|3 = 1 + 3 = 4, then he will win the game.<br>So you can see boyA will win if he choose the best strategy.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"No more than 1000 cases.
