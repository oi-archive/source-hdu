Did I miss much? <br><br>    Me: It&apos;s 2-1 for elAhli and the second half just started. The first half was quite boring. <br><br>    You: Who scored first? elAhli or ezZamalek? <br><br>    Me: What difference does it make? <br><br>    You: Big difference! I can predict the outcome of the match if I knew the order of which goals were scored in the first half. <br><br>    Me: What do you mean? <br><br>    You: It&apos;s 2-1 for elAhli, right? One of three things could have happened: elAhli scored two goals then ezZamalek scored; Or, elAhli scored its first goal, then ezZamalek, then elAhli again; Or, ezZamalek scored first, then elAhli scored its two goals. <br><br>    Me: So?!! I still don&apos;t understand what difference does that make? It&apos;s still 2-1 for elAhli! Why don&apos;t you just relax and let us continue watching the game in peace. <br><br>    You: You don&apos;t understand!! I believe the probability of who&apos;ll win depends on the order of how goals were scored. Now I have to predict the outcome for 3 possibilities. <br><br>    Me: And what if the score was 3-2? What would you have done then? <br><br>    You: I would have to work for 5 different possibilities. No? <br><br>    Me: Of course not! The number of possibilities isn&apos;t always equal to the sum. <br><br>    You: Can you tell me when will it be equal to the sum? <br><br>    Me: You&apos;re a programmer, why don&apos;t you write a program that counts the number of possibilities and compare it to the sum? <br><br>    You: I don&apos;t have the time, I want to watch the match. Besides, I have nine other problems to worry about. <br><br>    Me: I&apos;ll give you a hint. The possibilities will be equal to the sum only if one of the teams scored a certain number of goals.
