The park manger needs to build some railways along the roads, and he would like to arrange tourist routes to each circuit. If a railway belongs to more than one tourist routes, there might be clash on it, and if a railway belongs to none tourist route, it doesn&#x2019;t need to build.<br>Now we know the plan, and can you tell us how many railways are no need to build and how many railways where clash might happen.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The Input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers, n (0 &lt; n &lt;= 10000), m (0 &lt;= m &lt;= 100000), which are the number of locations and the number of the railways. The next m lines, each line contains two integers, u, v (0 &lt;= u, v &lt; n), which means the manger plans to build a railway on the road between u and v.<br>You can assume that there is no loop and no multiple edges.<br>The last test case is followed by two zeros on a single line, which means the end of the input.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Output the number of railways that are no need to build, and the number of railways where clash might happen.
