The job is interesting, well paid and nice in many <br>aspects, except for the company is a little far from home. So YY has to take bus to work every day early in the morning, and prays for no traffic jams along the road.<br><br>The route of the bus is fixed. It goes past N+1 landmarks one by one, the first of which is the bus-stop where YY gets on the bus, and the last is the company<br> where he should get off. If traffic jams do not occur, the time consumed to go between landmarks is also fixed &#x2014; Ti minutes from ith landmark to (i+1)th <br>landmark (1&#x2264;i&#x2264;N). However, if a traffic jam is encountered, things are different. After having been late for many times (and luckily enough not been fired by his<br> boss &amp; girlfriend LMY), YY has discovered that the road between two consecutive landmarks will be jammed only in a fixed time period in a day. If the bus is <br>between ith landmark and (i+1)th landmark (excluding at the two landmarks themselves) and encounters a traffic jam, additional Di minutes are needed to<br> get to (i+1)th landmark.<br><br>Given the time YY gets on the bus and the time his company start to work, could he reach the company in time?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"For each test case, the first line contains only one integer N.

Two integers comes first, Ti and Di (1&#x2264;Ti , Di&#x2264;60), indicating <br>the basic time consumption and additional time consumption with traffic jam for the bus to go between the two landmarks, in minutes.

Si is always strictly earlier than Ei, and they are always<br> in the same day.<br><br>The last line contains the time when YY gets on the bus and the time when the company starts to work, in HH:MM format (24 hours).
