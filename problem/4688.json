As the whole cake is too large and too heavy, a customer generally buys a specified part of it. The whole cake is a rectangle, while the specified part is a convex polygon region inside the rectangle. To get such specified part, Mehmet uses his sword to cut the cake. The only operation he can do is splitting a piece of cake into two parts by a straight cutting. As the cake is very solid, it cost as much as 1 unit energy to cut each length of cake. What&apos;s the minimum energy Mehmet has to consume to satisfy the customer?<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C463-1003-1.jpg\"></center>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
