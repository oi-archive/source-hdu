The park is beautiful - but large, indeed. N feature spots in the park are connected by exactly (N-1) undirected paths, and Claire is too tired to visit all of them. After consideration, she decides to visit only K spots among them. She takes out a map of the park, and luckily, finds that there&apos;re entrances at each feature spot! Claire wants to choose an entrance, and find a way of visit to minimize the distance she has to walk. For convenience, we can assume the length of all paths are 1.<br>Claire is too tired.
