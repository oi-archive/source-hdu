A number of enterprising designers have developed Advent-style games for deployment on the Y-Crate. Your job is to test a number of these designs to see which are winnable. <br>Each game consists of a set of up to 100 rooms. One of the rooms is the start and one of the rooms is the finish. Each room has an energy value between -100 and +100. One-way doorways interconnect pairs of rooms. <br><br>The player begins in the start room with 100 energy points. She may pass through any doorway that connects the room she is in to another room, thus entering the other room. The energy value of this room is added to the player&apos;s energy. This process continues until she wins by entering the finish room or dies by running out of energy (or quits in frustration). During her adventure the player may enter the same room several times, receiving its energy each time. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases.
