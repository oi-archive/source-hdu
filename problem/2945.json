Each machine is fixed at a certain location and each socket is fixed at a certain position. Different machines and socket may be located at the same position.<br><br>Bob wants to connect one machine with exactly one socket by using wire and he hopes that the total length of the wires is minimal.<br>In addition, we assume that:<br>Bob&#x2019;s floor can be described by m vertices in a 2-dimentional coordinate system. The m vertices are always given by clockwise or counter-clockwise. For simplicity, the edges of the polygon are always horizontal or vertical. For example, (0,0) (0,4) (4,4) (4,0) (2,0) (2,1) (3, 1) (3,2) (1,2) (1,0) describe the polygon which is shown in Figure 1, in which M1 and M2 are machines, S1 and S2 are sockets.<br><br>Wires can only be equipped within the polygon or on the edges of the polygon. Wires can be intercrossed.<br><br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/con210-1008-1.JPG\"></center> <br><br><br>Now please find out the minimal length of all the wires needed.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several cases.
