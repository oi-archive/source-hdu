Bored of normal games, Victor challenged Dragon with a competition of creep score (CS). In this competition, there are N enemy creeps for them. They hit the enemy one after another and Dragon takes his turn first. Victor uses a strong melee character so that in his turn, he will deal 1 damage to all creeps. Dragon uses a flexible ranged character and in his turn, he can choose at most one creep and deal 1 damage. If a creep take 1 damage, its health will reduce by 1. If a creep&#x2019;s current health hits zero, it dies immediately and the one dealt that damage will get one score. Given the current health of each creep, Dragon wants to know the maximum CS he can get. Could you help him?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"   The first line of input contains only one integer T(&lt;=70), the number of test cases. <br><br>   For each case, the first line contains 1 integer, N(&lt;=1000), indicating the number of creeps.
