Each course has an integer credit, ranges from 1 to 99. For each course, you will get a score at the end of the semester, which is an integer ranges from 0 to 100. Then you can calculate the Grade-Point of this course with the following formula. (Your score is x and your Grade-Point is p, using real arithmetic)<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C417-1007-1.jpg\"></center> <br>Then you can get the GPA with the following formula (the Grade-Point of course i is p<sub>i</sub>, and the credit of course i is w<sub>i</sub>).<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C417-1007-2.jpg\"></center> <br>Now it is not far from the final exam, if you do not review, you can only get a basic score in each course.<br><br>You have n days to review. There are K classes in each day. For each class, only one course can be reviewed. After the review, your score in this course will exactly increase by 1. You can get more increment by spending more classes in this course. But the score may not exceed 100.<br><br>For some reasons, not any course can be reviewed in any class. Each day you can only review some of the courses.<br><br>Now you want your GPA to be as high as possible, and at the same time, you do not want to fail in any course. Please calculate the highest GPA you can get. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases.
