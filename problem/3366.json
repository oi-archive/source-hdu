But unfortunately he was trapped in a castle. There are only n passages to go out. For any passage i (1&lt;=i&lt;=n), Pi (0&lt;=Pi&lt;=1) denotes the probability that Bill will escape from this castle safely if he chose this passage. Qi (0&lt;=Qi&lt;=1-Pi) denotes the probability that there is a group of guards in this passage. And Bill should give them one million dollars and go back. Otherwise, he will be killed. The probability of this passage had a dead end is 1-Pi-Qi. In this case Bill has to go back. Whenever he came back, he can choose another passage.<br>We already know that Bill has M million dollars. Help Bill to find out the probability that he can escape from this castle if he chose the optimal strategy.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer T (T&lt;=100) indicating the number of test cases.<br>The first line of each test case contains two integers n (1&lt;=n&lt;=1000) and M (0&lt;=M&lt;=10).<br>Then n lines follows, each line contains two float number Pi and Qi.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print the case number and the answer in a single line.<br>The answer should be rounded to five digits after the decimal point.<br>Follow the format of the sample output.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n1 10\n0.5 0\n2 0\n0.3 0.4\n0.4 0.5\n3 0\n0.333 0.234\n0.353 0.453\n0.342 0.532</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case 1: 0.50000\nCase 2: 0.43000\nCase 3: 0.51458</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=%A1%B0%B9%E2%CD%A5%B1%AD%A1%B1%B5%DA%CE%E5%BD%EC%BB%AA%D6%D0%B1%B1%C7%F8%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%D1%FB%C7%EB%C8%FC+%F4%DF+WHU%B5%DA%B0%CB%BD%EC%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%BE%BA%C8%FC&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x365;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xCEEA;&#xFFFD;&#x431;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; WHU&#xFFFD;&#x6B0;&#x2FD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x1BE;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
