Yuta is worrying about this situation, so he gives Rikka some math tasks to practice. There is one of them:<br><br>Yuta has a tree with n vertices, the length of each edge is exactly 1. For any none empty subset S of the vertices, value(S) is equal to max(dis(u,v))(u,v \\in S) which dis(u,v) is equal to the distance between u and v on the tree.<br><br>It is easy to find that value(S) satisfy 0&lt;=value(S)&lt;n. Now For each K in [0,n), Yuta wants to know the number of the subset S which satisfy value(S)=K.<br><br>It is too difficult for Rikka. Can you help her?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a number t(1&lt;=t&lt;=100), the number of the testcases. And there are no more than 5 testcases with n&gt;100.<br><br>For each testcase, the first line contains a number n(1&lt;=n&lt;=3000). Then n-1 lines follow, each line contains two numbers u and v, which means there is an edge between u and v.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each testcase, print a line contains exactly n numbers, the ith number is the number of none empty subsets S which satisfy value(S)=i-1. The answer may be very large, so you only need to print the answer module 998244353.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n2\n1 2\n4\n1 3\n2 4\n4 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2 1\n4 3 4 4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"&#x5B66;&#x519B;&#x4E2D;&#x5B66;","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2016+Multi-University+Training+Contest+8&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2016 Multi-University Training Contest 8 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
