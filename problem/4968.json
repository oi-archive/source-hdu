In this way, the AVERAGE SCORE is &#x2211;(SCOREi) / N. In addition, SCOREi are all integers between 60 and 100, and we guarantee that &#x2211;(SCOREi) can be divided by N.<br><br>   In SYSU, the university usually uses the AVERAGE SCORE as the standard to represent the students&#x2019; level. However, when the students want to study further in foreign countries, other universities will use the 4-Point Scale to represent the students&#x2019; level. There are 2 ways of transforming each score to 4-Point Scale. Here is one of them. <br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C508-1009-1.jpg\"></center><br><br>   The student&#x2019;s average GPA in the 4-Point Scale is calculated as follows:<center><b>GPA = &#x2211;(GPAi) / N</b></center><br>   So given one student&#x2019;s AVERAGE SCORE and the number of the courses, there are many different possible values in the 4-Point Scale. Please calculate the minimum and maximum value of the GPA in the 4-Point Scale. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The input begins with a line containing an integer T (1 &lt; T &lt; 500), which denotes the number of test cases.
