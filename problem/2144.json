The nucleotide bases from which DNA is built are A (adenine), C (cytosine), G (guanine), and T (thymine). Sometimes if two DNA of two living creatures have the same substring, and the length is beyond a certain percentage of the whole length, we many consider whether the two living creatures have the same ancestor. And we can separate them into a certain species temporarily for our research, and we say the two living creatures are similar Make sure if A is similar with B, and B is similar with C, but C is not similar with A, we also separate A, B and C into a kind, for during the evolution, there happens aberrance. <br>Now we have some kinds of living creatures and their DNA, just tell us how many kinds of living creatures we can separate.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"&#xA0;&#xA0;There are a lot of cases. In each case, in the first line there are two numbers N and P. N means the number of kinds of living creatures. If two DNA are similar, there exist a substring, and its length is beyond the percentage of any DNA of the two, and P is just the percentage. And 1&lt;=N&lt;=100, and 1&lt;=P&lt;100 (P is 100, which means two DNA are similar if and only if they are the same, so we make sure P is smaller than 100).
