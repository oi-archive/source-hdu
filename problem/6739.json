He has 3 basic skills in the game, which are Quas, Wex and Exort. Once he launches a basic skill, he will gain the corresponding element, where Quas gives &quot;Q&quot;, Wex gives &quot;W&quot; and Exort gives &quot;E&quot;.<br>Invoker can&apos;t have more than 3 elements simultaneously. If he launches a basic skill when he already owns 3 elements, he will get the corresponding element and lose the element he gained the earliest.<br>As can be seen, there are 10 unordered combinations of 3 elements in 3 types, each represents a special skill, which are as follows:<br><br><li> Cold Snap: unordered element combination &quot;QQQ&quot;, denoted by &quot;Y&quot;</li><br><li>  Ghost Walk: unordered element combination &quot;QQW&quot;, denoted by &quot;V&quot;</li><br><li>  Ice Wall: unordered element combination &quot;QQE&quot;, denoted by &quot;G&quot;</li><br><li>  EMP: unordered element combination &quot;WWW&quot;, denoted by &quot;C&quot;</li><br><li>  Tornado: unordered element combination &quot;QWW&quot;, denoted by &quot;X&quot;</li><br><li>  Alacrity: unordered element combination &quot;WWE&quot;, denoted by &quot;Z&quot;</li><br><li> Sun Strike: unordered element combination &quot;EEE&quot;, denoted by &quot;T&quot;</li><br><li> Forge Spirit: unordered element combination &quot;QEE&quot;, denoted by &quot;F&quot;</li><br><li> Chaos Meteor: unordered element combination &quot;WEE&quot;, denoted by &quot;D&quot;</li><li> Deafening Blast: unordered element combination &quot;QWE&quot;, denoted by &quot;B&quot;</li><br>When Invoker owns 3 elements, he can launch the invoking skill, denoted by &quot;R&quot;, to gain the special skill according to the elements he currently owns. After invoking, the elements won&apos;t disappear, and the chronological order of the 3 elements won&apos;t change.<br>Now given a sequence of special skills, you want to invoke them one by one with using the minimum number of basic skills(Q,W,E) and invoking skill(R). Print the minimum number in a single line.<br>At the beginning, Invoker owns no elements. And you should re-invoke the special skills even if you have already invoked the same skills just now.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input a single line containing a string s (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; |s| &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 100 000) that only contains uppercase letters in {B, C, D, F, G, T, V, X, Y, Z}, denoting the sequence of special skills.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Output a single line containing a positive integer, denoting the minimum number of skills to launch.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">XDTBVV</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">15\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nOne possible scheme is QWWREERERWQRQRR.\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=642ccpcQHD&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 642ccpcQHD </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
