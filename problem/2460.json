The network consists of N computers and M links between pairs of computers. Any pair of computers are connected directly or indirectly by successive links, so data can be transformed between any two computers. The administrator finds that some links are vital to the network, because failure of any one of them can cause that data can&apos;t be transformed between some computers. He call such a link a bridge. He is planning to add some new links one by one to eliminate all bridges.<br><br>You are to help the administrator by reporting the number of bridges in the network after each new link is added.
