The rules of the game are like this: You are in a two-dimensional plane and stand at $(0, 0)$. There are some obstacles above the x-axis. The location of each obstacle can be expressed as a tuple $(H, L, R)$, It means there is an obstacle at the height of $H$, interval $L$ to $R$. The $i_{th}$ obstacle with $W_i$ defense power. <br><br>You can shoot out &quot;Energy beam of life&quot;. Each time you can consume $X$ vitality then shoot out an energy beam with $X$ attack power. The energy beam is a ray, When an energy beam hit an obstacle. If it&apos;s attack power not less than defense power of obstacle, it will destroy and pass through this obstacle. Otherwise it will disappear in smoke.<br><br>Now you want to find an optimal strategy to destroy all obstacles and consume minimum vitality.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contain a integer $T$ (no morn than 10), the following is $T$ test case, for each test case :<br><br>The first line of each test case contains a integers n (1 $\\le$ n $\\le$ 300), number of obstacle. <br><br>Each of the next n lines contains 4 integers $H_i$, $L_i$, $R_i$, $W_i$, ($1\\le H_i\\le 1,000,000,000$, $-1,000,000,000\\le L_i\\le R_i\\le 1,000,000,000$, $0\\le W_i\\le 1,000,000,000$) means information of obstacles.
