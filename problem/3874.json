The necklace is made up of  N magic balls. Each ball has a beautiful value. The balls with the same beautiful value look the same, so if two or more balls have the same beautiful value, we just count it once. We define the beautiful value of some interval [x,y] as F(x,y). F(x,y) is calculated as the sum of the beautiful value from the xth ball to the yth ball  and the same value is ONLY COUNTED ONCE. For example, if the necklace is 1 1 1 2 3 1, we have F(1,3)=1, F(2,4)=3, F(2,6)=6.<br><br>Now Mery thinks the necklace is too long. She plans to take some continuous part of the necklace to build a new one. She wants to know each of the beautiful value of M continuous parts of the necklace. She will give you M intervals [L,R] (1&lt;=L&lt;=R&lt;=N) and you must tell her F(L,R) of them.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is T(T&lt;=10), representing the number of test cases.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;For each case, the first line is a number N,1 &lt;=N &lt;=50000, indicating the number of the magic balls.
