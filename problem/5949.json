In this problem, you only need to process molecules which contain hydrogen atoms, oxygen atoms, and carbon atoms. These three types of atom are written as &#x2019;H&#x2019;&#xFF0C;&#x2019;O&#x2019; and &#x2019;C&#x2019; repectively. For your information, the relative atomic mass of one hydrogen atom is 1, and the relative atomic mass of one oxygen atom is 16 and the relative atomic mass of one carbon atom is 12. A molecule is demonstrated as a string, of which each letter is for an atom. For example, a molecule &#x2019;HOH&#x2019; contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, therefore its relative atomic mass is 18 = 2 * 1 + 16.<br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains one integer N(N &#x2264; 10), the number of molecules.
