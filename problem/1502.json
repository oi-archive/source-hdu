Denote the number of occurences of A in a word a as A(a) , analogously let the number of occurences of B be denoted as B(a), and the number of occurenced of C as C(a) . <br><br>Let us call the word w regular if the following conditions are satisfied: <br><br>A(w)=B(w)=C(w) ; <br>if c is a prefix of w , then A(c)&gt;= B(c) &gt;= C(c) . <br>For example, if n = 2 there are 5 regular words: AABBCC , AABCBC , ABABCC , ABACBC and ABCABC . <br><br>Regular words in some sense generalize regular brackets sequences (if we consider two-letter alphabet and put similar conditions on regular words, they represent regular brackets sequences). <br><br>Given n , find the number of regular words.
