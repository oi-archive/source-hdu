Bert has quite successfully used rational numbers to write his programs but he does not like it when the denominator grows large. Your task is to help Bert by writing a program that decreases the denominator of a rational number, whilst introducing the smallest error possible. For a rational number A/B, where B &gt; 2 and 0 &lt; A &lt; B, your program needs to identify a rational number C/D such that:<br>1. 0 &lt; C &lt; D &lt; B, and<br>2. the error |A/B - C/D| is the minimum over all possible values of C and D, and<br>3. D is the smallest such positive integer.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input starts with an integer K (1 &lt;= K &lt;= 1000) that represents the number of cases on a line by itself. Each of the following K lines describes one of the cases and consists of a fraction formatted as two integers, A and B, separated by &#x201C;/&#x201D; such that:<br>1.
