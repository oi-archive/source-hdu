If you select the i-th frame, you must install a small pole at Pi, then place the i-th frame surrounding that pole (the pole is so small that it can be located on the frame border). You can place the frame anywhere, as long as the pole is inside it or on its border.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are at most 10 test cases.
