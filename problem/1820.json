A bishop can only move diagonally from its current position and two bishops attack each other if one is on the path of the other. In the following figure, the dark squares represent the reachable locations for bishop <b>B1</b> form its current position.  The figure also shows that the bishops <b>B1</b> and <b>B2</b> are in attacking positions whereas <b>B1</b> and <b>B3</b> are not. <b>B2</b> and <b>B3</b> are also in non-attacking positions. <br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/1820-1.jpg\"></center><br><br>Now, given two numbers <b>n</b> and <b>k</b>, your job is to determine the number of ways one can put <b>k</b> bishops on an <b>n &#xD7; n</b> chessboard so that no two of them are in attacking positions.
