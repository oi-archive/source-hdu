In one such game, all the frosh on a team stand in a line, and are then asked to arrange themselves according to some criterion, such as their height, their birth date, or their student number. This rearrangement of the line must be accomplished only by successively swapping pairs of consecutive students. The team that finishes fastest wins. Thus, in order to win, you would like to minimize the number of swaps required.
