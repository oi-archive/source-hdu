As a bright student, snowingsea, of course, takes it as a piece of cake. He feels boring and soon comes over drowsy.<br>Buge&#xFF0C;feels unhappy about him, he knocked at snowingsea&#x2019;s head, says:&#x201D;Go to solve the problem on the blackboard!&#x201D;, snowingsea suddenly wakes up, sees the blackboard written :<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C281-1002-1.jpg\"></center> <br><br>snowingsea thinks a moment&#xFF0C;and writes down:<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C281-1002-2.jpg\"></center> <br><br>snowingsea has a glance at Buge&#xFF0C;Buge smiles without talking, he just makes a little modification on the original problem, then it becomes :<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C281-1002-3.jpg\"></center> <br><br>The modified problem makes snowingsea nervous, and he doesn&apos;t know how to solve it. By the way&#xFF0C;Buge is famous for failing students, if snowingsea cannot solve it properly&#xFF0C; Buge is very likely to fail snowingsea. But snowingsea has many ACM friends. So&#xFF0C;snowingsea is asking the brilliant ACMers for help.
