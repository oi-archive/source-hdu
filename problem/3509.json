As a bright student, snowingsea, of course, takes it as a piece of cake. He feels boring and soon comes over drowsy.<br>Buge&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;feels unhappy about him, he knocked at snowingsea&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s head, says:&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Go to solve the problem on the blackboard!&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;, snowingsea suddenly wakes up, sees the blackboard written :<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C281-1002-1.jpg\"></center> <br><br>snowingsea thinks a moment&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;and writes down:<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C281-1002-2.jpg\"></center> <br><br>snowingsea has a glance at Buge&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Buge smiles without talking, he just makes a little modification on the original problem, then it becomes :<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C281-1002-3.jpg\"></center> <br><br>The modified problem makes snowingsea nervous, and he doesn&apos;t know how to solve it. By the way&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Buge is famous for failing students, if snowingsea cannot solve it properly&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; Buge is very likely to fail snowingsea. But snowingsea has many ACM friends.
