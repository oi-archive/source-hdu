She would like to endeavor to construct a periodic string with length $n(n \\leq 20000)$ to spare her tedious time. In every period of the string, the substring begins with dozens of `A`s and ends with dozens of `C`s, and dozens of `B`s are inserted between them, and the number of `A`, `B`, `C` is $a$, $b$, $c$.(For example, if $a=1$, $b=1$, $c=2$ then one of the period of the string is `ABCC`, and the periodic string is `ABCCABCC&#x2026;&#x2026;`).Note that in the last period of the string, the substring can be incomplete and the last few letters of the period can be cut down.<br><br>And now, Arabella has constructed a periodic string, she want to give you a question: if she tells you the character is $C_i(C_i \\in \\{A, B, C\\})$ in the $X_i(X_i \\leq 10000)$ , then could you tell her the value of $a,b,c$?  If there are multiple answers, please find the lexicographically smallest answer.
