He has a chain containing n diamonds on it. Diamonds are numbered from 1 to n.<br>At first, the diamonds on the chain is a sequence: 1, 2, 3, &#x2026;, n.<br>He will perform two types of operations:<br>CUT a b c: He will first cut down the chain from the ath diamond to the bth diamond. And then insert it after the cth diamond on the remaining chain.<br>For example, if n=8, the chain is: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8; We perform &#x201C;CUT 3 5 4&#x201D;, Then we first cut down 3 4 5, and the remaining chain would be: 1 2 6 7 8. Then we insert &#x201C;3 4 5&#x201D; into the chain before 5th diamond, the chain turns out to be: 1 2 6 7 3 4 5 8.<br><br>FLIP a b: We first cut down the chain from the ath diamond to the bth diamond. Then reverse the chain and put them back to the original position.<br>For example, if we perform &#x201C;FLIP 2 6&#x201D; on the chain: 1 2 6 7 3 4 5 8. The chain will turn out to be: 1 4 3 7 6 2 5 8<br><br>He wants to know what the chain looks like after perform m operations.
