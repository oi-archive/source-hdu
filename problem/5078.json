Basically, it is a game about clicking. Some points will appear on the screen at some time, and you have to click them at a correct time.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C549-1009-1.jpg\"></center><br>Now, you want to write an algorithm to estimate how diffecult a game is.<br><br>To simplify the things, in a game consisting of N points, point i will occur at time t<sub>i</sub> at place (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>), and you should click it exactly at t<sub>i</sub> at (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>). That means you should move your cursor from point i to point i+1. This movement is called a jump, and the difficulty of a jump is just the distance between point i and point i+1 divided by the time between t<sub>i</sub> and t<sub>i+1</sub>. And the difficulty of a game is simply the difficulty of the most difficult jump in the game.<br><br>Now, given a description of a game, please calculate its difficulty.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer T (T &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 10), denoting the number of the test cases.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains an integer N (2 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 1000) denoting the number of the points in the game.&#xA0;&#xA0;Then N lines follow, the i-th line consisting of 3 space-separated integers, t<sub>i</sub>(0 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; t<sub>i</sub> &lt; t<sub>i+1</sub> &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 10<sup>6</sup>), x<sub>i</sub>, and y<sub>i</sub> (0 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub> &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 10<sup>6</sup>) as mentioned above.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output the answer in one line.<br><br>Your answer will be considered correct if and only if its absolute or relative error is less than 1e-9.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n5\n2 1 9\n3 7 2\n5 9 0\n6 6 3\n7 6 0\n10\n11 35 67\n23 2 29\n29 58 22\n30 67 69\n36 56 93\n62 42 11\n67 73 29\n68 19 21\n72 37 84\n82 24 98</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">9.2195444573\n54.5893762558\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>In memory of the best osu! player ever Cookiezi.</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2014+Asia+AnShan+Regional+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2014 Asia AnShan Regional Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
