However sometimes you will submit invalid data, so we need a data checker to check your data. Now small W has prepared a problem for BC, but he is too busy to write the data checker. Please help him to write a data check which judges whether the input is an integer ranged from a to b (inclusive).<br>Note: a string represents a valid integer when it follows below rules.<br>    1. When it represents a non-negative integer, it contains only digits without leading zeros.<br>    2. When it represents a negative integer, it contains exact one negative sign (&apos;-&apos;) followed by digits without leading zeros and there are no characters before &apos;-&apos;.<br>    3. Otherwise it is not a valid integer.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Multi test cases (about 100), every case occupies two lines, the first line contain a string which represents the input string, then second line contains a and b separated by space.
