You want to color some cells to black, such that<br><br>- Black cells do not touch each other orthogonally(they do not share a side).<br>- We can draw a single continuous non-intersecting loop that passes through each cell that is not black. The loop must &quot;enter&quot; each cell from the centre of one of its four sides and &quot;exit&quot; from a different side; all turns are 90 degrees.<br><br>The following is an example.<br><br> <center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C887-1009-1.jpg\"></center> <br><br>In this problem, the weight of cells $(i,j) (1\\leq i,j \\leq n)$ is $w_{i,j}$.
