But Ran wasn&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t aware of Conan&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s disappearance. Then they went into the odeum, and the concert started.<br>Suddenly, the bombs in the odeum blasted and the whole building was on fire. All the audiences are trapped in the odeum, include Mouri Ran and Haibara Ai. Thousands of people are in danger now.<br><br>After the explosion, some walls have collapsed and blocked the way. Now Conan gets a map from the police, and he knows the location of all the hindrances. Also, he knows that Ran is a karate superior, and she can destroy some hindrances. (Horrific) As destroying the hindrance is a hard job, Conan wants to find a way to get out of the odeum crossing the least number of hindrances.<br><br>But the odeum is so large that it&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s not an easy work to find that way. Can you help Conan and the people trapped in the odeum?<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases.
