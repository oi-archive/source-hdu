Now, he is playing such a game. There are N rooms, each with one door. There are some keys(could be none) in each room corresponding to some doors among these N doors.

He will uniformly choose a door that can not be opened with the keys in his hand to destroy when there are no doors that can be opened with keys in his hand. Now, he wants to ask you, what is the expected number of bombs he will use to open or destroy all the doors.
