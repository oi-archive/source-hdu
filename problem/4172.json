If we think of this as a graph of vertices (of degree three), then there exists an isomorphism of the graph which maps any vertex x onto any other vertex y. Every edge is given a label from the set {a,b,c} in such a way that every vertex has all three types of edges incident on it, and the labels alternate around each octagon. Part of this labeling is illustrated in the diagram. <br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C386-1002-1.JPG\"></center><br><br>So a path in this graph (starting from any vertex) can be specified by a sequence of edge labels. Your job is to write a program which, given a squence of labels such as &quot;abcbcbcabcaccabb&quot;, returns &quot;closed&quot; if the path ends on the same vertex where it starts, and returns &quot;open&quot; otherwise. <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input will begin with a number Z &#x2264; 200 on a line by itself.
