For example:<br>    <b>123 -&gt; 132</b><br>    <b>279134399742 -&gt; 279134423799</b><br>It is possible that no permutation of the input digits has a larger value. For example, 987.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a single integer P, (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; P &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 1000), which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set is a single line that contains the data set number, followed by a space, followed by up to 80 decimal digits which is the input value.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each data set there is one line of output. If there is no larger permutation of the input digits, the output should be the data set number followed by a single space, followed by the string <b>BIGGEST</b>. Ifthere is a solution, the output  should be the data set number, a single space and the next larger<br>permutation of the input digits.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n1 123\n2 279134399742\n3 987</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1 132\n2 279134423799\n3 BIGGEST</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2009+Greater+New+York+Regional&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2009 Greater New York Regional </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
