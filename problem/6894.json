He wants to generate high quality data on border tree(There is no need to know what border tree is), but he encounters some troubles. Could you please help him? <br><br>In this paragraph we formally define the data quality problem. For some string $s = s_1s_2s_3\\cdots s_n$, we use $s[l:r]$ to denote the substring starts from $l$ and ends at $r$, if $l&gt;r$, $s[l:r]$ is empty. We further define:<br>$$Lborder_i = \\max\\{0\\leq j &lt; i\\ |\\ s[1:j] = s[i-j+1:i]\\}$$<br>to denote the longest border at some position $i$, then we define $D(i)$ to denote the length of border chain at position $i$: <br>$$D(i) = \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; i=0 \\\\ D(LBorder_i) + 1 &amp; i &gt; 0 \\end{cases}$$<br>The quality $W$ of this string is define as the maximum of $D$:<br>$$W = \\max_{i = 0}^{n} D(i)$$<br><br>To distinguish border tree with naive brute force algorithms, baby volcano need to generate strings such that its quality $W$ is as large as possible. <br><br>Now given a string $s$, you could permute $s$ arbitrarily. What is the maximum quality $W$ you could reach after permuting $s$?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"In the first line there is a number $T$($T\\leq 20$), denotes the number of test cases.<br>In the next $T$ lines, for each line there is a string $s$($1\\leq |s|\\leq 10^5$), denotes the input string, all inputs are formed in lowercases.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Output $T$ lines, for each line, you need to output &apos;&apos;Case #t: m&apos;&apos;(without quotes), where t is the index of this test case, m is the maximum quality you could reach after permuting.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5\nabcde\nsankaranarayanan\nabbccaabc\nprogramming\nmonotone</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 1\nCase #2: 7\nCase #3: 3\nCase #4: 2\nCase #5: 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2020%D6%D0%B9%FA%B4%F3%D1%A7%C9%FA%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%BE%BA%C8%FC%A3%A8CCPC%A3%A9+-+%CD%F8%C2%E7%D1%A1%B0%CE%C8%FC&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2020&#x4E2D;&#x56FD;&#x5927;&#x5B66;&#x751F;&#x7A0B;&#x5E8F;&#x8BBE;&#x8BA1;&#x7ADE;&#x8D5B;&#xFF08;CCPC&#xFF09; - &#x7F51;&#x7EDC;&#x9009;&#x62D4;&#x8D5B; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
