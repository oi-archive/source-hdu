One day, Jesse gave Mattew an integer sequence $A$ of length $n$ and marked one continuous subsequence $B$ of $A$ privately. Mattew didn&apos;t know the sequence $B$ at first, but he can guess out the sequence by conjectures. That is, once he claims some conjecture, Jesse will immediately tell him whether the conjecture is true or not.<br><br>Matthew has known the sequence $B$ is an interval selected from the sequence $A$ with equal probability. A wise man is never confused, so Matthew will minimize the expected number of conjectures he needs to figure out the sequence $B$. Could you please determine that expected value? Your answer should be an irreducible fraction $p / q$, which means $p$ and $q$ are coprime.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains one integer $T$, indicating the number of test cases.<br>The following lines describe all the test cases.
