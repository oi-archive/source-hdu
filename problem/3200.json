In other words, an arborescence is a directed, rooted tree in which all edges point away from the root. Every arborescence is a directed acyclic graph.&quot;-- from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br><br>You are given a directed graph with N vertices, and your task is to count the number of different arborescences of size N that can be found in the given graph.<br><br>Two arborescences are considered different when they consist of different edges.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input consists of multiple test cases.<br>For each test case, the first line contains one integer <i>N</i> described as above.<br>N lines follows, each consists of N characters, either &apos;0&apos; or &apos;1&apos;, representing the adjacency matrix of the graph.<br>The directed graph contains edge (i,j) if and only if the jth character of the ith line of the matrix is &apos;1&apos;.<br>The graph consists of no more than 8 vertices.<br>End of input is indicated by a line consisting of a single 0.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one line consisting of one single integer, the number of arborescences.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n00\n00\n2\n01\n10\n0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">0\n2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2009+Shanghai+Invitation+Contest+Host+by+DHU&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2009 Shanghai Invitation Contest Host by DHU </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
