It is guaranteed that no two points have the same coordinate, and no two points makes the line which passes them also passes the origin point. For every two points, there is a segment connecting them, and the segment has a value which equals the product of the values of the two points. Now HazelFan want to draw a line throgh the origin point but not through any given points, and he define the score is the sum of the values of all segments that the line crosses. Please tell him the maximum score.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a positive integer $T(1\\leq T\\leq5)$, denoting the number of test cases.<br>For each test case:<br>The first line contains a positive integer $n(1\\leq n\\leq5\\times10^4)$.<br>The next $n$ lines, the $i$th line contains three integers $x_i,y_i,val_i(|x_i|,|y_i|\\leq10^9,1\\leq val_i\\leq10^4)$.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case:<br>A single line contains a nonnegative integer, denoting the answer.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n2\n1 1 1\n1 -1 1\n3\n1 1 1\n1 -1 10\n-1 0 100</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n1100</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2017+Multi-University+Training+Contest+-+Team+7&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2017 Multi-University Training Contest - Team 7 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
