Suppose I send you the word &apos;BEAN&apos; encoded as 25114. You could decode that in many different ways!&#x201D;<br>Alice: &quot;Sure you could, but what words would you get? Other than &apos;BEAN&apos;, you&apos;d get &#x2018;BEAAD&#x2019;, &#x2018;YAAD&#x2019;, &#x2018;YAN&#x2019;, &#x2018;YKD&#x2019; and &#x2018;BEKD&#x2019;. I think you would be able to figure out the correct decoding. And why would you send me the word &#x2018;BEAN&#x2019; anyway?&#x201D;<br>Bob: &quot;OK, maybe that&apos;s a bad example, but I bet you that if you got a string of length 500 there would be tons of different decodings and with that many you would find at least two different ones that would make sense.&#x201D;<br>Alice: &quot;How many different decodings?&quot;<br>Bob: &quot;Jillions!&quot; <br><br>For some reason, Alice is still unconvinced by Bob&#x2019;s argument, so she requires a program that will determine how many decodings there can be for a given string using her code.<br><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Input will consist of multiple input sets.
