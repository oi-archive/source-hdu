His farm has a shape of convex polygon. There are $K$ barns in the farm. All of them are strictly inside the polygon. CRB wants to build a fence enclosing all the barns. He prepared $2K$ posts and steel strips of exactly the same length with the perimeter of his farm. A post can only be placed on the vertex of the polygon(farm), and steel strips must enclose all posts. Now, CRB wonders whether he can build a fence with currently available resources or not. Can you help him?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
