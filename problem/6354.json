His work is operating mechanical arms to cut out designed models. Here is a brief introduction of his work.<br>Assume the operating plane as a two-dimensional coordinate system. At first, there is a disc with center coordinates $(0, 0)$ and radius $R$. Then, $m$ mechanical arms will cut and erase everything within its area of influence simultaneously, the $i$-th area of which is a circle with center coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$ and radius $r_i$ $(i = 1, 2, \\cdots, m)$. In order to obtain considerable models, it is guaranteed that every two cutting areas have no intersection and no cutting area contains the whole disc.<br>Your task is to determine the perimeter of the remaining area of the disc excluding internal perimeter.<br>Here is an illustration of the sample, in which the red curve is counted but the green curve is not.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C722-1005-1.jpg\"></center>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains one integer $T$, indicating the number of test cases.<br>The following lines describe all the test cases.
