For example, suppose that 1 US Dollar buys 0.5 British pound, 1 British pound buys 10.0 French francs, and 1 French franc buys 0.21 US dollar. Then, by converting currencies, a clever trader can start with 1 US dollar and buy 0.5 * 10.0 * 0.21 = 1.05 US dollars, making a profit of 5 percent. <br><br>Your job is to write a program that takes a list of currency exchange rates as input and then determines whether arbitrage is possible or not.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file will contain one or more test cases. Om the first line of each test case there is an integer n (1&lt;=n&lt;=30), representing the number of different currencies. The next n lines each contain the name of one currency. Within a name no spaces will appear. The next line contains one integer m, representing the length of the table to follow. The last m lines each contain the name ci of a source currency, a real number rij which represents the exchange rate from ci to cj and a name cj of the destination currency. Exchanges which do not appear in the table are impossible.<br>Test cases are separated from each other by a blank line. Input is terminated by a value of zero (0) for n. <br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print one line telling whether arbitrage is possible or not in the format &quot;Case case: Yes&quot; respectively &quot;Case case: No&quot;. <br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\nUSDollar\nBritishPound\nFrenchFranc\n3\nUSDollar 0.5 BritishPound\nBritishPound 10.0 FrenchFranc\nFrenchFranc 0.21 USDollar\n\n3\nUSDollar\nBritishPound\nFrenchFranc\n6\nUSDollar 0.5 BritishPound\nUSDollar 4.9 FrenchFranc\nBritishPound 10.0 FrenchFranc\nBritishPound 1.99 USDollar\nFrenchFranc 0.09 BritishPound\nFrenchFranc 0.19 USDollar\n\n0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case 1: Yes\nCase 2: No</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=University+of+Ulm+Local+Contest+1996&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> University of Ulm Local Contest 1996 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
