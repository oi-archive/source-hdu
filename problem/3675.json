A grid from which the sensor arrays get no reading indicates a grid without any aircraft;<br>   2. A grid with a positive value indicates a trace of an aircraft, and in that grid, a) An aircraft may be present, or b) It is the trace of exactly one aircraft traveling either horizontal or vertical (notice the aircraft can&apos;t change the flying direction halfway);<br>   3. If a series of adjacent grids on a row or a column are the trace of one aircraft, then the amount of energy in them (from top to bottom or from left to right) must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases in the input file. Each test case starts with two integers, N  and M  (1&lt;=N&lt;=50, 1&lt;=M&lt;=9) , the length and width of the area that the you&apos;re monitoring. Each of the following N  lines consists of M  integers, the j -th integer on the i -th line representing the amount of heat sensed by the flight control&apos;s sensor array. It is guaranteed that every integer in the input will fit into a 32-bit signed integer.<br><br>There is a blank line after each test case.
