In a positional numeral system, the radix is the number of unique digits, including the digit $0$, used to represent numbers. For example, for the decimal system (the most common system in use today) the radix is ten, because it uses the ten digits from $0$ to $9$. Generally, in a system with radix $b$ ($b &gt; 1$), a string of digits $d_1 \\dots d_n$ denotes the number $d_1b^{n-1} + d_2b^{n-2} + \\dots + d_nb^0$, where $0 \\le d_i &lt; b$.<br><br>Little Rabbit casually writes down an equation. He wonders which radix this equation fits.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The are several test cases. Each test case contains a string in a line, which represents the equation Little Rabbit writes down. The length of the string is at most $15$. The input is terminated by the end-of-file.<br><br>The equation&apos;s format: number, operator, number, $=$, number. There&apos;s no whitespace in the string.<br><br>Each number has at least $1$ digit, which may contain digital numbers $0$ to $9$ or uppercase letters $A$ to $F$ (which represent decimal $10$ to $15$). The number is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer, which means it doesn&apos;t contain the radix point or negative sign. But the number may contain leading zeros. <br><br>The operator refers to one of $+$, $-$, $*$, or $/$. It is guaranteed that the number after $/$ will not be equal to $0$. Please note that the division here is not integer division, so $7/2=3$ is not correct.

If there are multiple answers, output the minimum one. If there is no answer between $2$ and $16$, output $-1$.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1+1=10\n18-9=9\nAA*AA=70E4\n7/2=3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n10\n16\n-1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2020+Multi-University+Training+Contest+6&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2020 Multi-University Training Contest 6 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
