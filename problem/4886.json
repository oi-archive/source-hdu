Nevertheless, TIANKENG wants his restaurant to go international, so he decides to name his restaurant in English. For the lack of English skills, TIANKENG turns to CC, an English expert, to help him think of a property name. CC is a algorithm lover other than English, so he gives a long string S to TIANKENG. The string S only contains eight kinds of letters-------&#x2018;A&#x2019;, &#x2018;B&#x2019;, &#x2018;C&#x2019;, &#x2018;D&#x2019;, &#x2018;E&#x2019;, &#x2018;F&#x2019;, &#x2018;G&#x2019;, &#x2018;H&#x2019;. TIANKENG wants his restaurant&#x2019;s name to be out of ordinary, so the restaurant&#x2019;s name is a string T which should satisfy the following conditions: The string T should be as short as possible, if there are more than one strings which have the same shortest length, you should choose the string which has the minimum lexicographic order.
