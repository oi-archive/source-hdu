He always searches for various &quot;Magic Towers&quot;.<br>  <br>  Jvjhfhg finds a game called &quot;Magic Tower - Step the Lamps&quot;.<br>  <br>  In an $n \\times m$ map($m$ is an odd number) where the first coordinate on the first line is $(1, 1)$ and the last coordinate on the last line is $(n, m)$, there&apos;s a &quot;lamp&quot; on every checker, which has two mode: on and off. At first, all &quot;lamps&quot; are switched OFF. Jvjhfhg sets off from a special checker $(0, \\frac{(m + 1)}{2})$ which as well as $(n + 1, \\frac{(m + 1)}{2})$ has no &quot;lamp&quot;. Of course stepping on these two checkers is available. When Jvjhfhg goes onto a has-lamp checker whose coordinate is $(x, y)$, the mode of the light of the checker, as well as those of the lights of $k + 1$ checker, namely $(x + x_1, y + y_1),(x + x_2, y + y_2),\\cdots ,(x + x_k, y + y_k)$, will alter. When all the &quot;lamps&quot; are on, the game ends. The author found that the game is so effortless when many checkers can only alter its own if the sum of ${x}_{i}$ and ${y}_{i}$ is too large or the map is too small, so he sets: $|xi| + |yi| \\leq 5$ and $n,m \\geq 5$.<br>  <br>  Jvjhfhg completes the game soonly, but he&apos;s still wondering how many paths can end the game. He finds that there could be infinite possibilities, so he decides that if all with-lamp checkers are passed for the number of times of same parities in two paths, these two paths are counted as one.<br>  <br>  **Print the answer modulo ${10}^{9}+7$.**<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer $T$ denoting the number of cases.<br>  <br>  For each case, the first line contains three integers $n,m,k$,while $m$ is odd.<br>  <br>  The next $k$ lines each contains two integers $x_i,y_i$.
