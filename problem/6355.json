All the species living in his space are regarded as fireflies for him. One day he came up with a problem but failed to solve it. Are you the one who can solve that?<br>There is one $n$-dimensional hypercubic subspace that he wants to cover by the minimal number of fireflies. The side lengths of the space are $p_1, p_2, \\cdots, p_n$, which means this space can be formed into $\\prod_{i = 1}^{n}{p_i}$ hypercubic units.<br>One unit is considered as covered if there exists a firefly that has visited it. Each firefly is able to cover several units through its own traveling. Assuming a firefly is located at the coordinate $(x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_n)$ with $1 \\leq x_i \\leq p_i$ $(i = 1, 2, \\cdots, n)$, it can move to another coordinate $(y_1, y_2, \\cdots, y_n)$ if $1 \\leq x_i \\leq y_i \\leq p_i$ $(i = 1, 2, \\cdots, n)$ and $\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{|x_i - y_i|} = 1$. In addition, The travel of one firefly can start or end at any location and might have any times of moves but one firefly could only travel once.<br>Your task is to determine the minimum number of fireflies that should be involved and print the answer in modulo $(10^9 + 7)$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains one integer $T$, indicating the number of test cases.<br>The following lines describe all the test cases.
