WisKey, our team leader, has to rescue her. They have escaped from Z&#x2019;s castle. But unfortunately, they lost in the forest. What&#x2019;s more, this forest is a big maze. There is only one place to leave. Z is familiar with the forest, and he will arrive at the place in T minutes. <br>To make the problem simply, we assume the forest is a N*M two-dimensional array which left-top corner is (0,0) and right-bottom corner is (N-1,M-1). The place they stayed now is marked S , and the place to leave is marked E. They could only move to empty place in four directions (up, down , left, right ), or stay at the place.<br>&gt;&#xA0;&#xA0;. : empty <br>&gt;&#xA0;&#xA0;X: the tree<br>&gt;&#xA0;&#xA0;S: the place Wiskey and XX now stay<br>&gt;&#xA0;&#xA0;E: the place to leave<br>Your task is to give out whether they can escape.
