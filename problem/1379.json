For instance, in the letter sequence ``DAABEC&apos;&apos;, this measure is 5, since D is greater than four letters to its right and E is greater than one letter to its right. This measure is called the number of inversions in the sequence. The sequence ``AACEDGG&apos;&apos; has only one inversion (E and D)--it is nearly sorted--while the sequence ``ZWQM&apos;&apos; has 6 inversions (it is as unsorted as can be--exactly the reverse of sorted). <br><br>You are responsible for cataloguing a sequence of DNA strings (sequences containing only the four letters A, C, G, and T). However, you want to catalog them, not in alphabetical order, but rather in order of ``sortedness&apos;&apos;, from ``most sorted&apos;&apos; to ``least sorted&apos;&apos;. All the strings are of the same length. <br><br><br>This problem contains multiple test cases!<br><br>The first line of a multiple input is an integer N, then a blank line followed by N input blocks.
