There is $a_i$ stones on the $i$th pile. On one turn, the player can move exactly one stone from one pile to another pile. After one turn, if there exits a number $x(x &gt; 1)$ such that for each pile $b_i$ is the multiple of $x$ where $b_i$ is the number of stone of the this pile now), the game will stop. Now you need to help Bob to calculate the minimum turns he need to stop this boring game. You can regard that $0$ is the multiple of any positive number.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is the number of test cases.
