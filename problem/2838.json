Each cow has a unique &quot;grumpiness&quot; level in the range 1...100,000. Since grumpy cows are more likely to damage Sherlock&apos;s milking equipment, Sherlock would like to reorder the cows in line so they are lined up in increasing order of grumpiness. During this process, the places of any two cows (necessarily adjacent) can be interchanged. Since grumpy cows are harder to move, it takes Sherlock a total of X + Y units of time to exchange two cows whose grumpiness levels are X and Y.<br><br>Please help Sherlock calculate the minimal time required to reorder the cows.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Line 1: A single integer: N<br>Lines 2..N + 1: Each line contains a single integer: line i + 1 describes the grumpiness of cow i.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Line 1: A single line with the minimal time required to reorder the cows in increasing order of grumpiness.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n2\n3\n1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">7\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nInput Details\n\nThree cows are standing in line with respective grumpiness levels 2, 3, and 1.\nOutput Details\n\n2 3 1 : Initial order.\n2 1 3 : After interchanging cows with grumpiness 3 and 1 (time=1+3=4).\n1 2 3 : After interchanging cows with grumpiness 1 and 2 (time=2+1=3).\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2009+Multi-University+Training+Contest+3+-+Host+by+WHU+&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2009 Multi-University Training Contest 3 - Host by WHU  </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
