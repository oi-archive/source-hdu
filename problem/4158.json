At the end of the game, the score for each player is the total area of the territory surrounded by his or her stones. Given the locations of black and white stones on a Go board at the end of a match, your task is to compute the score of each player in order to determine the winner.1<br>Formally, two grid lattice points with coordinates (r, c) and (r&#x2032;, c&#x2032;) are adjacent if |r - r&#x2032;| + |c - c&#x2032;| = 1. A connected region of unfilled lattice points belongs to one player&#x2019;s territory if all adjacent filled lattice points contain stones belonging to that player (see Figure 1). Finally, a player&#x2019;s score consists of the number of unfilled lattice points in his or her territory.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C384-1005-1.jpg\"></center><br>Note that the scoring of Go boards described here does not correspond exactly to the real game of Go: we make the simplifying assumptions that all &#x201C;disputes&#x201D; have been settled so that any territories surrounded by stones of both colors are considered neutral, and that all groups on the board are considered &#x201C;alive.&#x201D;<br><br>Figure 1: Diagram of a 9 &#xD7; 9 Go board. Unfilled lattice points belonging to black&#x2019;s territory are marked with B, and unfilled lattice points belonging to white&#x2019;s territory are marked with W. Neutral unfilled lattice points are unmarked. In the game above, white wins by 21-3 = 18.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input test file will contain multiple cases, each consisting of three lines.
