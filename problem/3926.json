He knows kids love games and works out a new game called &quot;hand in hand&quot;. <br><br>Initially kids run on the playground randomly. When Kid says &quot;stop&quot;, kids catch others&apos; hands immediately. One hand can catch any other hand randomly. It&apos;s weird to have more than two hands get together so one hand grabs at most one other hand. After kids stop moving they form a graph.<br><br>Everybody takes a look at the graph and repeat the above steps again to form another graph. Now Kid has a question for his kids: &quot;Are the two graph isomorphism?&quot; <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single positive integer T( T &lt;= 100 ), indicating the number of datasets.<br>There are two graphs in each case, for each graph:<br>    first line contains N( 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^4 ) and M indicating the number of kids and connections.<br>    the next M lines each have two integers u and v indicating kid u and v are &quot;hand in hand&quot;.<br>    You can assume each kid only has two hands.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case: output the case number as shown and &quot;YES&quot; if the two graph are isomorphism or &quot;NO&quot; otherwise.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n\n3 2\n1 2\n2 3\n3 2\n3 2\n2 1\n\n3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n3 1\n1 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: YES\nCase #2: NO</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2011+Multi-University+Training+Contest+9+-+Host+by+BJTU&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2011 Multi-University Training Contest 9 - Host by BJTU </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
