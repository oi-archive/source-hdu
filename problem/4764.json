To decide whose treat it is for dinner, they are playing a game. Specifically, Tang and Jiang will alternatively write numbers (integers) on a white board. Tang writes first, then Jiang, then again Tang, etc... Moreover, assuming that the number written in the previous round is X, the next person who plays should write a number Y such that 1 &lt;= Y - X &lt;= k. The person who writes a number no smaller than N first will lose the game. Note that in the first round, Tang can write a number only within range [1, k] (both inclusive). You can assume that Tang and Jiang will always be playing optimally, as they are both very smart students.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
