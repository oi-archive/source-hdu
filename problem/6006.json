For example, MapReduce experts, Bigtable experts, SQL experts, etc. Directors need to properly assign experts to various projects in order to make the projects going smoothly.<br>There are N projects owned by a director. For the $i^{th}$ project, it needs $C_i$ different areas of experts, $a_{i,0}, a_{i,1}, &#xB7; &#xB7; &#xB7; , a_{i,C_i-1}$  respective. There are M engineers reporting to the director. For the $i^{th}$ engineer, he is an expert of $D_i$ different areas, $b_{i,0}, b_{i,1}, ... , b_{i,D_i-1}.$<br>Each engineer can only be assigned to one project and the director can assign several engineers to a project. A project can only be finished successfully if the engineers expert areas covers the project areas, which means, for each necessary area of the project, there is at least one engineer<br>masters it.<br>The director wants to know how many projects can be successfully finished.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T.
