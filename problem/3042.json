The number of people m back from the circle out until only left one person so far.<br>But now, we think about another Josephus problem. At the first, the circle includes n person. From the first one to start to call the number until call the m, we add a person beside the person who calls the number m, and the new person calls the number at the next round. Repeat this process, until k person in the circle. Now, label the n individuals, for the order of 1...n. The new added person label n+1...n+k by order. And we are interest in what the label the person whose rank is p.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;To simplify the problem, we only think about when m=1. For example, N=3 and k=12, the circle is changed as follows:&#xA0;&#xA0;<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/vipcon10-1003-1.JPG\"></center> <br>Now ,the first one&#x2019;s label is 1 and the second is 7,is third is 4,the forth is 8,the fifth is 2,the sixth is 9,the seventh is 5,the eighth<br>is 10,the ninth is 3,the tenth is 11,the eleventh is 6,the twelfth<br>is 12.  <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There many cases. <br>For every case:<br><br>The first line, two integer n(1&lt;=n&lt;=10^9),k(n&lt;k&lt;=10^9),q(1&lt;=q&lt;10^4),<br>N is the initial person, k is the final number of person, q is the number of query. <br>Then next q lines, every line contains an integer p as a query. <br>(1&lt;=p&lt;=k)<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For every case: <br><br>Total q lines, for every line, output the person&#x2019;s lable who is now ranked p-th. <br>","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3 12 2\n3\n5</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4\n2\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nHint: \n\nm is always 1. \n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2009+Multi-University+Training+Contest+14+-+Host+by+ZJNU&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2009 Multi-University Training Contest 14 - Host by ZJNU </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
