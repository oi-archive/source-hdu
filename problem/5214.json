A movie has $N$ scenes can be chosen, and each scene is associate with an interval [$L$, $R$]. $L$ is the beginning time of the scene and $R$ is the ending time. However, they can&apos;t choose two scenes which have overlapping intervals. (For example, scene with [1, 2] and scene with [2, 3], scene with [2, 5] and scene with[3, 4]). <br><br>Now, can you tell them if they can choose such three scenes that any pair of them do not overlap? <br><br>Since there are so many scenes that you can&apos;t get them in time, we will give you seven parameters $N,~L_1,~R_1,~a,~b,~c,~d$, and you can generate $L_1$ ~ $L_N$, $R_1$ ~ $R_N$ by these parameters.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer $T$, indicating the number of test cases.<br><br>Each test case contains seven integers $N,~L_1,~R_1,~a,~b,~c,~d$, meaning that there are $N$ scenes.
