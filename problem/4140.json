Yes it is finally what we all have been waiting for so long, extending the built-in calculator functionality!<br>On of the suggested extensions is adding the capability of evaluating polynomials, and that&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s what you are thrilled to participate with!<br>In this problem you&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;re given a polynomial entered by the user in the calculator and are asked to evaluate it for a certain value.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains T (0 &lt; T &lt;= 100) the number of polynomials, each test cases consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer (-1000 &lt;= X &lt;= 1000), the value for the variable X for which the polynomial is evaluated.<br>The second line contains a polynomial P with integer coefficients. P is a sum of terms of the form CX^E , where the coefficient C and the exponent E satisfy the following conditions:<br>1. E is an integer satisfying (0 &lt;= E &lt;= 30). If E is 0, then CX^E is expressed as C. If E is 1, then CX^E is expressed as CX, unless C is 1 or -1. In those instances, CX^E is expressed as X or -X.<br>2. C is an integer. If C is 1 or -1 and E is not 0 or 1, then the CX^E will appear as X^E or -X^E.<br>3. Only non-negative C values that are not part of the first term in the polynomial are preceded by +.<br>4. Exponents in consecutive terms are strictly decreasing.<br>5. C fits in a 32-bit signed integer.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print the value of polynomial evaluation.
