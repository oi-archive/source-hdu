Each children must be given at least $1$ and at most $m$ candies. The children raised $k$ pieces of requirements, and every piece includes three integers $x,y,z$, means that the number of candies given to the child numbered $x$, subtract the number of candies given to the child number $y$, the result should not be more than $z$. Besides, if the child numbered $i$ is given $j$ candies, he or she will get $w_{i,j}$ satisfaction score, now you need to help HazelFan maximize the sum of the satisfaction scores of these children.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a positive integer $T(1\\leq T\\leq5)$, denoting the number of test cases.<br>For each test case:<br>The first line contain three positive integers $n,m,k(1\\leq n,m\\leq50,1\\leq k\\leq150)$.<br>The next $n$ lines, the $i$th line contains $m$ positive integers, the $j$th integer denotes $w_{i,j}$.<br>The next $k$ lines, each line contains three integers $x,y,z(1\\leq x,y\\leq n,\\mid z\\mid&lt;233)$, denoting a piece of requirement.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case:<br>A single line contains a nonnegative integer, denoting the answer.
