The girl who has the most number of votes will be the first. You as a student representing Hdu Acm team has a chance to vote. Every girl who participates in the activity has an unique No. and name. Because you very like prime number, you will vote for the girl whose No. has the maximum number of unique prime factors.  <br> <img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C191-1003-01.jpg\"> <br>For example if the girl&apos;s No. is 12, and another girl&apos;s No. is 210, then you will choose the girl with No. 210. Because 210 = 2 *3 * 5*7 , 12 = 2*2*3. 210 have 4 unique prime factors but 12 just have 2. If there are many results, you will choose the one whose name has minimum lexicographic order.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contain an integer T (1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100).Then T cases followed.
