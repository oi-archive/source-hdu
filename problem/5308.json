She wants to become a master of this game, so she asks Yuta to give her some problems to practice.<br><br>Quickly, Rikka solved almost all of the problems but the remained one is really difficult:<br><br>In this problem, you need to write a program which can get 24 points with $n$ numbers, which are all equal to $n$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are no more then 100 testcases and there are no more then 5 testcases with $n \\geq 100$.

You need to print $n-1$ lines and the $i$th line contains one integer $a$, one char $b$ and then one integer c, where $1 \\leq a,c &lt;n+i$ and $b$ is &quot;+&quot;,&quot;-&quot;,&quot;*&quot; or &quot;/&quot;. This line means that you let $A_a$ and $A_c$ do the operation $b$ and store the answer into $A_{n+i}$.<br><br>If your answer satisfies the following rule, we think your answer is right:<br><br>1. $A_{2n-1}=24$<br><br>2.
