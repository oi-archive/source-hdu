But soon he got lost&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<br>      The amusement park has N sites and N bidirectional roads connecting these sites. You can start from every site to get to any other site through the roads. Every time Biaoge got to a site, he marked it as visited and then chose a new site which was connected directly to it and not visited yet. If there were more than one site meet the conditions, Biaoge would choose randomly with equal possibility.<br>      Biaoge also chose the first site among N sites randomly with equal possibility and then repeated this process until there was no site to go.<br>      Calculate the possibility for each site of being the last site which Biaoge would visit. And output <strong>the sum of five largest possibilities</strong>.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"      There are multiple test case.<br>      For each test case the first line contains an Integer N(5&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;N&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;100000) indicating the number of sites(All sites are labeled from 1 to N) .
