Now he wants to make the graph become a complete bipartite graph with most edges by adding some extra edges. Soda needs you to tell him the maximum number of edges he can add.<br><br>Note: There must be at most one edge between any pair of vertices both in the new graph and old graph.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer $T$ $(1 \\le T \\le 100)$, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case:<br><br>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$, $(2 \\le n \\le 10000, 0 \\le m \\le 100000)$.<br><br>Each of the next $m$ lines contains two integer $u, v$ $(1 \\le u, v \\le n, v \\ne u)$ which means there&apos;s an undirected edge between vertex $u$ and vertex $v$.<br><br>There&apos;s at most one edge between any pair of vertices.
