The i+1st line contains the coordinates of ith point belonging to the pattern: x_i i y_i (-20000 &lt;= x_i, y_i &lt;= 20000). The points forming the pattern are pairwise different. In the next line there is the number of sets to be investigated: n (1 &lt;= n &lt;= 20). Next, there are n descriptions of these sets. The description of each set begins with a line containing a single integer l - the number of points belonging to that particular set (1 &lt;= l &lt;= 25000). These points are described in the following lines, a single point per line. The description of a point consists of two integers separated by a single space - its coordinates x, y (-20000 &lt;= x, y &lt;= 20000).
