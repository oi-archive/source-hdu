However, he is puzzled by a difficult mathematics problem. The problem is: Given three integers N, K and M, N may adds (&#x2018;+&#x2019;) M, subtract (&#x2018;-&#x2018;) M, multiples (&#x2018;*&#x2019;) M or modulus (&#x2018;%&#x2019;) M (The definition of &#x2018;%&#x2019; is given below), and the result will be restored in N. Continue the process above, can you make a situation that &#x201C;[(the initial value of N) + 1] % K&#x201D; is equal to &#x201C;(the current value of N) % K&#x201D;? If you can, find the minimum steps and what you should do in each step. Please help poor Coco to solve this problem. <br><br>You should know that if a = b * q + r (q &gt; 0 and 0 &lt;= r &lt; q), then we have a % q = r.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple cases.
