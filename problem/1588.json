So if you wanna me be your GF, you should solve the problem called GF~. &quot;<br>How good an opportunity that Gardon can not give up!  The &quot;Problem GF&quot; told by Angel is actually &quot;Gauss Fibonacci&quot;.<br>As we know ,Gauss is the famous mathematician who worked out the sum from 1 to 100 very quickly, and Fibonacci is the crazy man who invented some numbers.<br><br>Arithmetic progression:<br>g(i)=k*i+b;<br>We assume k and b are both non-nagetive integers.<br><br>Fibonacci Numbers:<br>f(0)=0<br>f(1)=1<br>f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) (n&gt;=2)<br><br>The Gauss Fibonacci problem is described as follows:<br>Given k,b,n ,calculate the sum of every f(g(i)) for 0&lt;=i&lt;n<br>The answer may be very large, so you should divide this answer by M and just output the remainder instead.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains serveral lines.
