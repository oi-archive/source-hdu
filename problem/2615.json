Each jewel has own value.<b> They put the jewels in a line, and don&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t swap the position of jewel.</b> In order to division the jewels, they think a lot of ideas. At last, they decide a way to division by voting. First let Ctw to divide the line into two non-empty sublines (each subline express a group of jewel). Second yifenfei will to divide one of sublines and also divide it into two non-empty sublines. Than let lemon to choose one of this three sublines., than yifenfei choose one of remaining subline. At last Ctw hold the last subline..<br>Every one wants to maximize their own share. But because yifenfei don&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t like Ctw, so if there are two divisions let himself get the some value, he will choose the way let Ctw get smaller values.<br>Assuming every one have full knowledge of each other&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s strategies and make their decision optimally.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains multiple test cases.<br>Each test case include, first one integers n.
