One day, Clarke turned into a junior student and took a chemistry exam.  <br>But he did not get full score in this exam. He checked his test paper and found a naive mistake, he was wrong with a simple chemical equation balancer.  <br>He was unhappy and wanted to make a program to solve problems like this.  <br>This chemical equation balancer follow the rules:  <br>Two valences $A$ combined by $|A|$ elements and $B$ combined by $|B|$ elements.  <br>We get a new valence $C$ by a combination reaction and the stoichiometric coefficient of $C$ is $1$. Please calculate the stoichiometric coefficient $a$ of $A$ and $b$ of $B$ that $aA + bB = C,\\ \\ a, b \\in \\text{N}^*$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer $T(1 \\le T \\le 10)$, the number of test cases.  <br>For each test case, the first line contains three integers $A, B, C(1 \\le A, B, C \\le 26)$, denotes $|A|, |B|, |C|$ respectively.  <br>Then $A+B+C$ lines follow, each line looks like $X\\ c$, denotes the number of element $X$ of $A, B, C$ respectively is $c$. ($X$ is one of $26$ capital letters, guarantee $X$ of one valence only appear one time, $1 \\le c \\le 100$)","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, if we can balance the equation, print $a$ and $b$. If there are multiple answers, print the smallest one, $a$ is smallest then $b$ is smallest. Otherwise print NO.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n2 3 5\t\nA 2\nB 2\nC 3\nD 3\nE 3\nA 4\nB 4\nC 9\nD 9\nE 9\n2 2 2\nA 4\nB 4\nA 3\nB 3\nA 9\nB 9</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2 3\nNO\n\nHint:\nThe first test case, $a=2, b=3$ can make equation right.  \nThe second test case, no any answer.</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=BestCoder+Round+%2372+%28div.2%29&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> BestCoder Round #72 (div.2) </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
