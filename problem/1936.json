This may seem like a nice feature for many, but a lot of people find it really annoying and wants to get rid of emoticons.<br><br>George is one of those people. He hates emoticons so bad, that he is preparing a plan to remove all emoticons from all e-mails in the world. Since you share his visionary plans, you are preparing a special program to help him.<br><br>Your program will receive the list of emoticons to proscribe. Each emoticon will be a string of characters not including any whitespace. You will also receive several lines of text. What you need to do is change some characters of the text into spaces to ensure no emoticon is left on the text. For an emoticon to be considered to appear in the text it has to appear in a single line and be made of consecutive characters.<br><br>To help George&#x2019;s plan remain secret as long as possible, you need to do your job with the minimum possible amount of character changes.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file contains several test cases.
