You already designed the track; it is a round trip that is described by an inner and an outer polygon. The space in between the two polygons is the track.<br><br>You still need to design the rafts, however. It has been decided that they should be circular, so that they can spin freely along the track and increase the fun and excitement of the ride. Besides that, they should be as big as possible to fit the maximum number of people, but they can&apos;t be too big, for otherwise they would get stuck somewhere on the track.<br><br>What is the maximum radius of the rafts so that they can complete the track?
