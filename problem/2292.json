He is working on binary trees recently and particularly interested in complete binary trees.<br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/2292-1.jpg\"> <br><br>A complete binary tree satisfies that all levels of the tree, except possibly the last one (deepest) are fully filled, and, if the last level of the tree is not complete, the nodes of that level are filled from left to right.<br>Alex defines his own complete binary tree: each node has a weight, while father&apos;s is always less than or equal to its sons&apos;. He names this complete binary tree as minimum heap.<br><br>Now he wants to know: With N nodes weighted from 1 to N (each appears once), how many heaps can be created. The answer (represented by Q) may be very large, so please output a number P while P = Q mod M.<br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases.
