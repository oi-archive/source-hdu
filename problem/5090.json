The rule of the game is:<br><br>   1) Tom and Jerry come up together with a number K. <br><br>   2) Tom provides N tubes. Within each tube, there are several pearls. The number of pearls in each tube is at least 1 and at most N. <br><br>   3) Jerry puts some more pearls into each tube. The number of pearls put into each tube has to be either 0 or a positive multiple of K. After that Jerry organizes these tubes in the order that the first tube has exact one pearl, the 2nd tube has exact 2 pearls, &#x2026;, the Nth tube has exact N pearls.<br><br>   4) If Jerry succeeds, he wins the game, otherwise Tom wins. <br><br>   Write a program to determine who wins the game according to a given N, K and initial number of pearls in each tube. If Tom wins the game, output &#x201C;Tom&#x201D;, otherwise, output &#x201C;Jerry&#x201D;.
