From the historical research, we found that there are much difference on the rules between ancient go and modern go.<br><br>Here is the rules for ancient go they were playing:<br><br>$\\cdot$The game is played on a $8&#xD7;8$ cell board, the chess can be put on the intersection of the board lines, so there are $9&#xD7;9$ different positions to put the chess.<br>$\\cdot$Yu Zhou always takes the black and Su Lu the white. They put the chess onto the game board alternately.<br>$\\cdot$The chess of the same color makes connected components(connected by the board lines), for each of the components, if it&apos;s not connected with any of the empty cells, this component dies and will be removed from the game board.<br>$\\cdot$When one of the player makes his move, check the opponent&apos;s components first. After removing the dead opponent&apos;s components, check with the player&apos;s components and remove the dead components.<br>One day, Yu Zhou was playing ancient go with Su Lu at home. It&apos;s Yu Zhou&apos;s move now. But they had to go for an emergency military action.
