Each switch is connected to a subset of these lamps. When a switch is flipped, all the lamps connected to it change its state (on to off and off to on).","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers N and M (0&lt;N&lt;=50, 0&lt;M&lt;=100), which stand for the number of lamps and swithes. Then M lines follows, each line contains N characters. The jth character of the ith line is &apos;1&apos; if the ith switch is connected to the jth lamp, and &apos;0&apos; otherwise. The next line is a integer Q, which is the number of queries. Each of following Q lines contains the initial and target state of lamps (&apos;0&apos; is off and &apos;1&apos; is on).","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each query, output &quot;Yes&quot; if it is possible to change the state from initial to target with these swithes.
