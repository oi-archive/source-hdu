Steph always finds them too easy for such a genius like himself until one day Klay comes up with a problem and ask him about it.<br><br>Given two integer sequences {ai} and {bi} with the same length n, you are to find the next n numbers of {ai}: $a_{n+1}&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;a_{2n}$. Just like always, there are some restrictions on $a_{n+1}&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;a_{2n}$: for each number $a_i$, you must choose a number $b_k$ from {bi}, and it must satisfy $a_i$&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;max{$a_j$-j&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;$b_k$&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;j&lt;i}, and any $b_k$ can&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t be chosen more than once. Apparently, there are a great many possibilities, so you are required to find max{$\\sum_{n+1}^{2n}a_i$} modulo $10^9$+7 .<br><br>Now Steph finds it too hard to solve the problem, please help him.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains no more than 20 test cases.<br>For each test case, the first line consists of one integer n.
