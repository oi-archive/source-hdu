His students are very lazy and they do not like to do their homework. One day, Mr. Furion decides to give them a special problem in order to see whether his students are talents in math or they are just too lazy to do their homework. The problem is:<br><br><br>Given an integer k, n integers m<sub>1</sub>,m<sub>2</sub>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;m<sub>n</sub>, and a formula below: <br><br>X<sub>1</sub> xor X<sub>2</sub> xor X<sub>3</sub>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; xor X<sub>n</sub> = k <br><br>Please figure out that how many integral solutions of the formula can satisfy:<br><br>0&lt;=X<sub>i</sub>&lt;=m<sub>i</sub> (i=1&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;n)","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are at most 100 test cases.<br><br>The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k. The second line of each test contains n integers: m<sub>1</sub>,m<sub>2</sub>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;m<sub>n</sub>. The meaning of n,k, m<sub>1</sub>,m<sub>2</sub>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;m<sub>n</sub> are described above.
