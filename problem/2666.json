A positive integer called a weight is assigned to each letter of the alphabet. A weight of a word built from the letters of the alphabet Ak is the sum of weights of all letters in this word. A language over an alphabet Ak is any finite set of words built from the letters of this alphabet. A weight of a language is the sum of weights of all its words. We say that the language is prefixless if for each pair of different words w, v from this language w is not a prefix of v.  <br><br>We want to find out what is the minimal possible weight of an n-element, prefixless language over an alphabet Ak.  <br><br>Example <br>Assume that k = 2 , the weight of the letter a - W(a)=2 and the weight of the letter b - W(b) = 5. The weight of the word ab - W(ab)= 2+5=7. W(aba)=2+5+2=9. The weight of the language J = {ab, aba, b} - W(J) = 21. The language J is not prefixless, since the word ab is a prefix of aba. The lightest tree-element, prefixless language over the alphabet A2 (assuming that weights of the letters are as before) is {b, aa, ab}; its weight is 16.  <br><br>Task <br>Write a program that:  <br>1.reads two integers n, k and the weights of k letters of an alphabet Ak;  <br>2.computes the minimal weight of a prefixless, n-element language over the alphabet Ak;  ","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is the number of test cases. <br>For each test cast, there are two positive integers n and k separated by a single space, (2&lt;=n&lt;=10000, 2&lt;=k&lt;=26). These are the number of words in a language and the number of letters in an alphabet respectively. The second line contains k positive integers separated by single spaces.
