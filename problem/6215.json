Algorithms are not Beerus&apos;s strength. Destruction is what he excels. He can destroy all unsorted numbers in the array simultaneously. A number $A[i]$ of the array is sorted if it satisfies the following requirements.<br>1. $A[i]$ is the first element of the array, or it is no smaller than the left one $A[i-1]$.<br>2. $A[i]$ is the last element of the array, or it is no bigger than the right one $A[i+1]$.<br>In $[1,4,5,2,3]$, for instance, the element $5$ and the element $2$ would be destoryed by Beerus. The array would become $[1,4,3]$. If the new array were still unsorted, Beerus would do it again.<br>Help Beerus predict the final array.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains an integer $T~(1\\le T\\le 10)$ which is the total number of test cases.<br>For each test case, the first line provides the size of the inital array which would be positive and no bigger than $100000$.<br>The second line describes the array with $N$ positive integers $A[1],A[2],\\cdots,A[N]$ where each integer $A[i]$ satisfies $1\\le A[i]\\le 100000$.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For eact test case output two lines.<br>The first line contains an integer $M$ which is the size of the final array.<br>The second line contains $M$ integers describing the final array.<br>If the final array is empty, $M$ should be $0$ and the second line should be an empty line.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n5\n5 4 3 2 1\n5\n1 2 3 2 1\n5\n1 3 5 4 2\n5\n2 4 1 3 5</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5\n1 2 3 4 5 \n0\n\n2\n1 2 \n2\n1 3 \n3\n2 3 5 </div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2017+ACM%2FICPC+Asia+Regional+Qingdao+Online&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2017 ACM/ICPC Asia Regional Qingdao Online </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
