We number these $N$ sticks from number 1 to $N$, from left to right. <br><br>Today, BrotherK is bored, so he wants to cut his wood stick. <br><br>First, he chooses two arrays $A,~B$: each one has $M$ elements : $A_1$ ~ $A_M$, $B_1$ ~ $B_M$. Next he chooses a permution of 1 ~ $M$ randomly(All possible permutations have equal probability). Assume the permutaion is $P_1$ ~ $P_M$. If there exists an $I$ in $[1,~M]$ such that $A_I~\\gt~B_{P_I}$, BrotherK will choose another permutation randomly, until there is not any $I$ such that $A_I~\\gt~B_{P_I}$. <br><br>For each $I$ in $[1,~M]$, he will paint black on sticks between the interval $[A_I,~B_{P_I}]$. <br><br>Finally, BrotherK cuts all black sticks. There may remain some white sticks. <br><br>Now, BrotherK wants to know the expected length of the longest white stick.(If after painting, all sticks are black, then we consider the length as 0).","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer $T$, indicating the number of test cases.<br><br>Each test case begins with two integers $N,~M$, indicating the length of the original stick, and the number of the elements in array $A,~B$. <br><br>The second line contains $M$ numbers, from $A_1$ to $A_M$. <br><br>The third line contains $M$ numbers, from $B_1$ to $B_M$.<br><br>$T$ is about 20.<br><br>$1~\\le~N~\\le~1000000$.<br><br>$1~\\le~M~\\le~50$.<br><br>$1~\\le~A_i, B_i~\\le~N.$","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test, print one lines.<br><br>If BrotherK can&apos;t find a valid permutation, print &quot;Stupid BrotherK!&quot; (without quotation marks). <br><br>Otherwise, print the expected length.
