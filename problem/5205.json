Yuta is worrying about this situation, so he gives Rikka some math tasks to practice. There is one of them:<br><br><br>A non-directed graph $G$ has no multiple edges and self loops. If every connected component of G has an Euler&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s circuit, we call G perfect. Now Yuta wants to know the numbers of different perfect graphs which has $n$ vertices and no less than $m$ edges (In this problem, we think all the $n$ vertices are different from each other)<br><br><br>It is too difficult for Rikka. Can you help her?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"This problem has multi test cases (no more than $100$).
