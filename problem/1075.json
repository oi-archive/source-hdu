A line with a single string &quot;END&quot; indicates the end of the directory part, and this string should be ignored. The book part starts with a single line contains a string &quot;START&quot;, this string should be ignored, then an article written in Martian&apos;s language. You should translate the article into English with the dictionary. If you find the word in the dictionary you should translate it and write the new word into your translation, if you can&apos;t find the word in the dictionary you do not have to translate it, and just copy the old word to your translation. Space(&apos; &apos;), tab(&apos;\\t&apos;), enter(&apos;\\n&apos;) and all the punctuation should not be translated. A line with a single string &quot;END&quot; indicates the end of the book part, and that&apos;s also the end of the input.
