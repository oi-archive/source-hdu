You are destined to recover the Amulet for your deity, or die in the attempt. Your hour of destiny has come. For the sake of us all: Go bravely with The Lady!<br><br>If you have ever played the computer game NETHACK, you must be familiar with the quotes above. If you have never heard of it, do not worry. You will learn it (and love it) soon.<br><br>In this problem, you, the adventurer, are in a dangerous dungeon. You are informed that the dungeon is going to collapse. You must find the exit stairs within given time. However, you do not want to leave the dungeon empty handed. There are lots of rare jewels in the dungeon. Try collecting some of them before you leave. Some of the jewels are cheaper and some are more expensive. So you will try your best to maximize your collection, more importantly, leave the dungeon in time.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Standard input will contain multiple test cases. The first line of the input is a single integer T (1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10) which is the number of test cases. T test cases follow, each preceded by a single blank line.<br><br>The first line of each test case contains four integers W (1 &lt;= W &lt;= 50), H (1 &lt;= H &lt;= 50), L (1 &lt;= L &lt;= 1,000,000) and M (1 &lt;= M &lt;= 10). The dungeon is a rectangle area W block wide and H block high. L is the time limit, by which you need to reach the exit. You can move to one of the adjacent blocks up, down, left and right in each time unit, as long as the target block is inside the dungeon and is not a wall. Time starts at 1 when the game begins. M is the number of jewels in the dungeon. Jewels will be collected once the adventurer is in that block. This does not cost extra time.<br><br>The next line contains M integers&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;which are the values of the jewels.<br><br>The next H lines will contain W characters each.
