To get accepted by the Martians, he decided to make a magic necklace for their king. (Otherwise, JYY will be eaten) Now, he has collected many magic balls, and he is going to string them up.<br>    Unfortunately, only particular pairs of balls can be adjacent in the necklace, otherwise they will explode. Notice that the first and the last ball in the necklace are also adjacent. Besides, the Martians think even numbers are unlucky, so the number of balls in the necklace must be odd. (Of course each ball can be used only once)<br>    A necklace contains at least 3 balls. Because the balls are really precious, JYY wants the necklace has as few balls as possible. (Then he can give rest balls to his GF)<br>    So JYY wonders the number of balls he has to use to make this necklace.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases.
