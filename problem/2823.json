Now the head of the village decided to make a road through the village and it must be straight, for a straight line makes the way shortest and meanwhile, saves the cost. At that time, the heads of the two families proposed, because they didn&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t want their own families live separated along the two sides of the road, thus it might decrease the solidarity of family. Besides, the two families were antipathetic to each other; neither wanted to live together with the other in a same side of the road. Then it made the village head in a pickle, he hoped the road to be as wide as possible. So what&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s the possible maximal width of this road?<br>In order to simplify the problem, let&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s regard the living place of each family member is just a point.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases in the input.<br><br>The first line of each input contains n and m (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; m,n &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 1000).
