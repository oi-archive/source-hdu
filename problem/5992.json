For each test case, the first line contains two integers N (N &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 200000) and M (M &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 20000). Each of the following N lines describes a hotel with 3 integers x (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; x &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N), y (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; y &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N) and c (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; c &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N), in which x and y are the coordinates of the hotel, c is its price. It is guaranteed that each of the N hotels has distinct x, distinct y, and distinct c. Then each of the following M lines describes the query of a guest with 3 integers x (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; x &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N), y (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; y &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N) and c (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; c &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; N), in which x and y are the coordinates of the guest, c is the maximum acceptable price of the guest.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each guests query, output the hotel that the price is acceptable and is nearest to the guests location.
