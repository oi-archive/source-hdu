One day he made a simplified version of the game. The chess board is relatively smaller. He will first place only three kinds of chesses on his own behalf, namely the Chariot(&quot;ju&quot;), the Horse(&quot;ma&quot;) and the Cannon(&quot;pao&quot;). Then he placed some chesses on the opposite&apos;s behalf. There will be one and only one chess of the opposite marked as the General(&quot;shuai&quot;). Mr Li wants to kill the General as soon as possible without killing other chesses.<br>    All chesses will move in the same way as in real chess games(The chinese chess).<br>    To make the game easier, the opposite&apos;s chesses will stand still.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"For each test case,the first line contains two integers n and m(2&lt;=n,m&lt;=10) indicating the size of the borad.
