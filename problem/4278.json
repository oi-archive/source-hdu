The odometer has a defect, however: it proceeds from the digit 2 to the digit 4 and from the digit 7 to the digit 9, always skipping over the digit 3 and 8. This defect shows up in all positions (the one&apos;s, the ten&apos;s, the hundred&apos;s, etc.). For example, if the odometer displays 15229 and the car travels one mile, odometer reading changes to 15240 (instead of 15230).<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"&#x3000;&#x3000;Each line of input contains a positive integer in the range 1..999999999 which represents an odometer reading.
