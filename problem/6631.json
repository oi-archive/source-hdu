Please check whether we can move at most one point such that the simple polygon becomes a line-symmetric simple polygon.<br><br>Note that you cannot reorder these points. If you move the $i$-th point, it still connects to the $(i-1)$-th point and the $(i+1)$-th point in the original order. Also, you cannot move a point to a location having an existing point.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer $T$ indicating the number of tests.<br><br>Each test begins with one line containing one integer $n$, denoting the number of points in the polygon. Then, the $i$-th line in the following $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i, y_i$, $(x_i, y_i)$ is the coordinate of the $i$-th point. For any $1 \\le i &lt; n$, the $i$-th point is connected to the $(i+1)$-th point with an edge. Also, the $n$-th point is connected to the first point.<br><br>* $1 \\le T \\le 40$<br><br>* $3 \\le n \\le 1000$<br><br>* coordinates are in the range $[-1000, 1000]$","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test, if you can move at most one point making the polygon line-symmetric, print a character &apos;Y&apos; in a line, otherwise print a character &apos;N&apos; in a line.
