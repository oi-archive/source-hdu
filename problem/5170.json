To have more time to learn algorithm knowledge, he never does his math homework. His math teacher is very unhappy for that, but she can&apos;t do anything because GTY can always get a good mark in math exams. One day, the math teacher asked GTY to answer a question. There are four numbers on the blackboard - $a, b, c, d$. The math teacher wants GTY to compare $ a^b $ with $ c^d $. Because GTY never does his homework, he can&apos;t figure out this problem! If GTY can&apos;t answer this question correctly, he will have to do his homework. So help him!","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Multi test cases (about 5000).
