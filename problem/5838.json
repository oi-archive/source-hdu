But this map is too old to get the clear information,so Zhu only knows cells which are valleys.<br><br>A cell is called valley only if its height is less than the heights of all its adjacent cells.If two cells share a side or a corner they are called adjacent.And one cell will have eight adjacent cells at most.<br><br>Now give you $N$ strings,and each string will contain $M$ characters.Each character will be &apos;.&apos; or uppercase &apos;X&apos;.The j-th character of the i-th string is &apos;X&apos; if the j-th cell of the i-th row  in the mountain map is a valley, and &apos;.&apos; otherwise.Zhu wants you to calculate the number of distinct mountain maps that match these strings.<br><br>To make this problem easier,Zhu defines that the heights are integers between $1$ and $N*M$.Please output the result modulo $772002$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of multiple test cases. <br><br>Each test case begins with a line containing two non-negative integers $N$ and $M$.
