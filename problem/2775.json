It is a variant on draw poker. In this game the player gets a hand consisting of five cards randomly drawn from a standard 52-card deck. From this hand, the player may discard any number of cards (between 0 and 5, inclusive), and change them for new cards randomly drawn from the remainder of the deck. After that, the hand is evaluated and the player is rewarded according to a payout structure. A common payout structure is as follows:<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C179-1011-1.jpg\"></center><br>Once you know the payout structure, you can determine for a given hand which cards you must change to maximize your expected reward. We&apos;d like to know this expected reward, given a hand.
