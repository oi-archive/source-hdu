Thus the trees form a rectangular grid and we can consider the trees to have integer coordinates. The origin of the coordinate system is at the bottom left of the following diagram: <br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1633-1.gif\"><br>Consider that we now overlay a series of triangles on to this grid. The vertices of the triangle can have any real coordinates in the range 0.0 to 100.0, thus trees can have coordinates in the range 1 to 99. Two possible triangles are shown. <br><br>Write a program that will determine how many trees are contained within a given triangle. For the purposes of this problem, you may assume that the trees are of point size, and that any tree (point) lying exactly on the border of a triangle is considered to be in the triangle. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input will consist of a series of lines.
