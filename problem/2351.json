Given a collection of numbers, you are to find the<br>most interesting ones.<br><br>A number X is more interesting than another number Y if it has more attributes than Y. For the purposes of this problem, the attributes that are<br>interesting are:<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/c131-1001-1.jpg\"></center><br><br>Note that 0 has no multiples other than itself, and 1 is not prime.<br><br>In addition to the above attributes, there are also those which depend on the other numbers in a given collection:<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/c131-1001-2.jpg\"></center><br><br>This makes for a total of thirteen possible attributes. Note that meeting the criteria for a particular attribute in multiple ways (1 is the factor of all<br>other numbers, for example) still only counts as a single instance of an attribute.<br><br>Given a collection of numbers, you are to determine which numbers in that collection are most interesting.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer N (1 &#x2264; N &#x2264; 100) indicating the number of data sets.
