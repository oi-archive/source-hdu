People imagine that some groups of stars in the sky form so-called constellations. Formally a constellation is a group of stars that are connected together to form a figure or picture. Some well-known constellations contain striking and familiar patterns of bright stars. Examples are Orion (containing a figure of a hunter), Leo (containing bright stars outlining the form of a lion), Scorpius (a scorpion), and Crux (a cross).<br><br>In this problem, you are to find occurrences of given constellations in a starry sky. For the sake of simplicity, the starry sky is given as a N &#xD7; M matrix, each cell of which is a &apos;*&apos; or &apos;0&apos; indicating a star in the corresponding position or no star, respectively. Several constellations are given as a group of T P &#xD7; Q matrices. You are to report how many constellations appear in the starry sky.<br><br>Note that a constellation appears in the sky if and only the corresponding P &#xD7; Q matrix exactly matches some P &#xD7; Q sub-matrix in the N &#xD7; M matrix.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of multiple test cases.

There is a blank line preceding each constellation.<br>The last test case is followed by a line containing five zeros.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print a line containing the test case number( beginning with 1) followed by the number of constellations appearing in the sky.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3 3 2 2 2\n*00\n0**\n*00\n\n**\n00\n\n*0\n**\n3 3 2 2 2\n*00\n0**\n*00\n\n**\n00\n\n*0\n0*\n0 0 0 0 0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case 1: 1\nCase 2: 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2008+Asia+Hefei+Regional+Contest+Online+by+USTC&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2008 Asia Hefei Regional Contest Online by USTC </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
