According to the research, the universe in common sense is not the only one. Multi World Line is running simultaneously. In simplicity, let us use a straight line in three-dimensional coordinate system to indicate a single World Line.<br><br>During the research in World Line Alpha, the assistant of Dr. Kyouma, also the Labman No.004, Christina dies. Dr. Kyouma wants to save his assistant. Thus, he has to build a Time Tunnel to jump from World Line Alpha to World Line Beta in which Christina can be saved. More specifically, a Time Tunnel is a line connecting World Line Alpha and World Line Beta. In order to minimizing the risks, Dr. Kyouma wants you, Labman No.003 to build a Time Tunnel with shortest length.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer T, indicating the number of test cases. <br><br>Each case contains only one line with 12 float numbers (x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2), (x3, y3, z3), (x4, y4, z4), correspondingly indicating two points in World Line Alpha and World Line Beta.
