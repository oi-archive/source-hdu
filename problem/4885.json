Every day he drives the car around the city. After a month TIANKENG finds that he has got high driving skills and he wants to drive home. Assuming that we regard the map of Hangzhou as a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, the coordinate of the school is (sx, sy), the coordinate of TIANKENG&#x2019;s home is (ex,ey). There are n gas stations distributing along the road and the coordinate of the ith gas station is (xi, yi). Because there is something wrong with the car engine, TIANKENG can drive the car for L miles after every time he fills up the gas. Assuming that TIANKENG must fill up the gas when he passes by a gas station and the initial status of the tank is full. TIANKENG must drive on the straight line and he can only choose to drive to school or home or gas station. Your task is to tell TIANKENG the minimum times he needs to charge fuel to go home successfully.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a positive integer T(T&lt;=30), referring to T test cases.<br>For each test case, the first line contains two integers n(0&lt;=n&lt;=1000), L(1&lt;=L&lt;=100000), which mean n gas stations in all and the distance TIANKENG can drive with the full tank respectively.
