The $N$ cities are connected by $N-1$ roads, and any two cities are reachable via a sequence of roads. Obviously, the road system of the Kingdom of Tree is constructed according to a tree structure. That&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s how the kingdom&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s name comes.<br><br>To monitor and protect the roads, the general of the kingdom decides to build radar stations in the cities. We denote the radius of the radar station located in city $i$ as $R_i$. $R_i$ is a non-negative integer, and $R_i=0$ indicates that there is no radar station in city $i$. Given a road connecting city $i$ and city $j$, whose length is denoted as $L_{i,j}$, we say that the road is monitored by radar if $R_i+R_j&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;L_{i,j}$.<br><br>The cost of building a radar station in city $i$ is proportional to its radius $R_i$. Given a construction plan of the radar stations $P=\\{R_1,R_2,...,R_N \\}$, we denote the set of monitored roads as S. The cost per length is thus defined as the ratio between the sum of $R_i$ and the sum of the length of monitored roads: $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} R_{i}/\\sum_{(i,j)&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;S}L_{i,j}$.<br><br>Due to limited budget, the general wants to make the most of the money. He wants a construction plan that minimizes the cost per length. Note that he don&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t have to monitor all the roads. As the most brilliant programmer of the Kingdom of Tree, can you help him to find such a construction plan?<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a number $T$ indicating the number of test cases ($T&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;200$).<br><br>Each test case starts with a line containing an integer $N$ indicating the number of cities ($2&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;N&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;30$).
