It turns out that they\\&apos;ve been following you, and they were amazed by the fact that you were accelerating the whole time without using the brakes! And now you desperately need an excuse to explain that.<br><br>You&apos;ve decided that it would be reasonable to say &quot;all the speed limit signs I saw were in increasing order, that\\&apos;s why I&apos;ve been accelerating&quot;. The police officer laughs in reply, and tells you all the signs that are placed along the segment of highway you drove, and says that&apos;s unlikely that you were so lucky just to see some part of these signs that were in increasing order.<br><br>Now you need to estimate that likelihood, or, in other words, find out how many different subsequences of the given sequence are strictly increasing. The empty subsequence does not count since that would imply you didn&apos;t look at any speed limits signs at all!<br><br>For example, (1, 2, 5) is an increasing subsequence of (1, 4, 2, 3, 5, 5), and we count it twice because there are two ways to select (1, 2, 5) from the list.
