Real tests are not possible until the design has been finalized and the IC has been produced. <br><br><br>To simulate the behavior of a digital IC and to more or less guarantee that the final chip will work, all of today&apos;s digital ICs are based on a synchronous design. <br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1656-1.gif\"><br>Figure: The critical path (dashed line) takes 43ns to settle<br>In a synchronous design, an external clock signal triggers the IC to go from a well defined and stable state to the next one. On the active edge of the clock, all input and output signals and all internal nodes are stable in either the high or low state. Between two consecutive edges of the clock, the signals and nodes are allowed to change and may take any intermediate state. The behavior of a synchronous network is predictable and will not fail due to hazards or glitches introduced by irregularities of the real circuit. <br><br><br>To analyze whether an IC has a synchronous design, we distinguish between synchronous and  . Flip flops are synchronous nodes. On the active edge of the clock, the output of the flip flop changes to the state of the input and holds that state throughout the next clock cycle. Synchronous nodes are connected to the clock signal. <br><br><br>Simple gates like ANDs or ORs are asynchronous nodes. Their output changes - with a short delay - whenever one of their inputs changes. During that transition phase, the output can even go into some undefined or intermediate state. <br><br><br>For simplicity, we assume that all inputs of the circuits are directly connected to the output of a synchronous node outside the circuit and that all outputs of the circuit are directly connected to the input of a synchronous node outside the circuit. <br><br>For an IC to have a synchronous design, mainly two requirements must be met: <br><br><br>The  introduced between two synchronous nodes must be smaller or equal than the clock period so there is enough time for nodes to become stable. In figure 1, the round-ended boxes are asynchronous nodes whereas the square boxes are synchronous nodes. The delay introduced on the dashed path is 43ns and exceeds the given clock period of 30ns.<br>There may be  composed exclusively of asynchronous nodes. In the real circuit such cycles could oscillate. In figure 2, the dashed path constitutes a cycle of asynchronous nodes. <br>Figure 3 shows a circuit with a synchronous design. It does not contain cycles composed of asynchronous nodes and the longest path between two synchronous nodes is shorter than the clock period of 30ns. <br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1656-2.gif\"> <br>Figure: The design contains a cycle (dashed line)<br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1656-3.gif\"> <br>Figure: A synchronous design<br>Your are to write a program that decides for a given IC whether it has a synchronous design or not.
