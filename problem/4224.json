Here is such a case. iSea is fond of coins recently, now he gets three coins, after throwing all of them again and again, he finds some of those coins are not side equivalent, because the times it faces up and faces down are not equal. Here we assume iSea has thrown the coin enough times that we can treat this as random happened and use the number to count probability. <br>iSea is a typical Libra, placing in equilibrium at the first position always. He want to distribute the probability to the three coins, and each time he chooses a coin from them with this probability, throws the coin, records facing up or down, and this time after summing up all the times whether the coins face up or down the ideal probable number should be perfectly equal. Again, is this possible? Remember the probability for each coin can&#x2019;t be zero.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer T, indicating the number of test cases.<br>Each test case includes Six integers Up1, Down1, Up2, Down2, Up3, Down3, indicating the times  facing up and down of the first, second and third coin, respectively.<br><br><b>Technical Specification</b><br>1. 1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10 000<br>2. 1 000 000 &lt;= Up, Down &lt;= 2 000 000<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output the case number first, if possible, output &quot;Yes&quot;, otherwise output &quot;No&quot; (without quote).","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n1000000 1000001 1000000 1000002 1000000 1000003\n1000000 1000001 1000000 1000002 2000000 1000003</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case 1: No\nCase 2: Yes</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"iSea@WHU","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=%CA%D7%BD%EC%BB%AA%D6%D0%C7%F8%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%D1%FB%C7%EB%C8%FC%F4%DF%B5%DA%CA%AE%BD%EC%CE%E4%BA%BA%B4%F3%D1%A7%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%B4%F3%C8%FC&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> &#x9996;&#x5C4A;&#x534E;&#x4E2D;&#x533A;&#x7A0B;&#x5E8F;&#x8BBE;&#x8BA1;&#x9080;&#x8BF7;&#x8D5B;&#x66A8;&#x7B2C;&#x5341;&#x5C4A;&#x6B66;&#x6C49;&#x5927;&#x5B66;&#x7A0B;&#x5E8F;&#x8BBE;&#x8BA1;&#x5927;&#x8D5B; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
