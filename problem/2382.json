The gate into which your ball falls determines the winnings. <br><br>Since you can more or less determine the column into which the ball is dropped (by setting its initial speed and direction), you can influence your win chances. You are to calculate your expected winnings. <br><br>We model the pachinko machine as follows: you can drop the ball in any column and it falls down until it either reaches the bottom of the machine (which results in no wins), a gate (indicated by a number 1 to 9, which results in that win) or an obstacle (indicated by a asterisk). If a ball hits an obstacle it proceeds falling in the column to the left or to the right of the obstacle, with 50/50 probability. No two obstacles or gates are adjacent, not even diagonally, and none is located in the leftmost or rightmost column. <br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"On the first line an integer t (1 &lt;= t &lt;= 100): the number of test cases.
