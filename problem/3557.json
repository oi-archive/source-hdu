We call two strings are similar only if they have at least one character whose number of occurrences in the two strings are equal and not zero.<br>Then they two play another totally different sub-divide game. To ensure fairness, another player has the first chance.<br>In this game, two players make an operation in turn. In a round, a player chooses one string, divides the pile into two non-similar strings, if he can&apos;t divide it, then he just moves the string away. The one who gets the last operation is the winner.<br>Now iSea have a clever challenger, who always choose the optimum strategy, if they two play the divide game, and iSea have the chance to divide the string in the first game, can he win the final game?<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases in the input.<br><br>Each test case only contain one string (length &lt;= 50000, and only include uppercase), indicating the original string.<br><br>The input terminates by end of file marker.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output &quot;Yes&quot; if iSea can win, otherwise output &quot;No&quot;.<br><br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">AA\nABC</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">No\nYes</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"iSea@WHU","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2010+ACM-ICPC+Multi-University+Training+Contest%A3%A812%A3%A9%A1%AA%A1%AAHost+by+WHU&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2010 ACM-ICPC Multi-University Training Contest&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;12&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Host by WHU </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
