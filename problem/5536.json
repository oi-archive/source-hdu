To manage large amounts of products, every processor has a serial number. More specifically, the factory produces $n$ chips today, the $i$-th chip produced this day has a serial number $s_i$.<br><br>At the end of the day, he packages all the chips produced this day, and send it to wholesalers. More specially, he writes a checksum number on the package, this checksum is defined as below:<br>$$\\max_{i,j,k} (s_i+s_j) \\oplus s_k$$<br>which $i,j,k$ are three <b>different</b> integers between $1$ and $n$. And $\\oplus$ is symbol of bitwise XOR.<br><br>Can you help John calculate the checksum number of today?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains an integer $T$ indicating the total number of test cases.<br><br>The first line of each test case is an integer $n$, indicating the number of chips produced today.
