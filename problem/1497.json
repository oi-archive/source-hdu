One day he goes to an old library to find a part-time job .It is also a big library which has N books and M users.The user&apos;s id is from 1 to M , and the book id is from 1 to N . According to the library rules , every user are only allowed to borrow 9 books .But what surprised him is that there is no computer in the library , and everything is just recorded in paper ! How terrible , I must be crazy after working some weeks , he thinks .So he wants to change the situation .<br><br>In the other hand , after 8006&apos;s fans  know it , they all collect money and buy many computers for the library .<br><br>Besides the hardware , the library needs a management program . Though it is just a piece of cake for 8006 , the library turns to you , a excellent programer,for help .<br><br>What they need is just a simple library management program . It is just a console program , and have only three commands : Borrow the book , Return the book , Query the user .<br><br>1.The Borrow command has two parameters : The user id and the book id<br>The format is : &quot;B ui bi&quot;    (1&lt;=ui&lt;=M , 1&lt;=bi&lt;=N)<br>The program must first check the book bi wether it&apos;s in the library . If it is not , just print &quot;The book is not in the library now&quot; in a line . <br>If it is , then check the user ui .<br>If the user has borrowed 9 books already, print &quot;You are not allowed to borrow any more&quot; .<br>Else let the user ui borrow the book , and print &quot;Borrow success&quot;.<br><br>2.The Return command only has one parameter : The book id<br>The format is : &quot;R bi&quot; (1&lt;=bi&lt;=N)<br>The program must first check the book bi whether it&apos;s in the library . If it is , just print &quot;The book is already in the library&quot; . Otherwise , you can return the book , and print &quot;Return success&quot;.<br><br>3.The Query command has one parameter : The user id<br>The format is : &quot;Q ui&quot; (1&lt;=ui&lt;=M)<br>If the number of books which the user ui has borrowed is 0 ,just print &quot;Empty&quot; , otherwise print the books&apos; id which he borrows in increasing order in a line.Seperate two books with a blank.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file contains a series of test cases .
