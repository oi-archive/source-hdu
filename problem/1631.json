It is syntactically unambiguous, culturally neutral and metaphysically parsimonious. What follows is a gross over-simplification of an already very small grammar of some 200 rules. <br><br>Loglan sentences consist of a series of words and names, separated by spaces, and are terminated by a period (.). Loglan words all end with a vowel; names, which are derived extra-linguistically, end with a consonant. Loglan words are divided into two classes--little words which specify the structure of a sentence, and predicates which have the form CCVCV or CVCCV where C represents a consonant and V represents a vowel (see examples later). <br><br>The subset of Loglan that we are considering uses the following grammar: <br><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1631-1.gif\"><br><br>Write a program that will read a succession of strings and determine whether or not they are correctly formed Loglan sentences.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Each Loglan sentence will start on a new line and will be terminated by a period (.). The sentence may occupy more than one line and words may be separated by more than one whitespace character. The input will be terminated by a line containing a single `#&apos;. You can assume that all words will be correctly formed. <br><br>Output will consist of one line for each sentence containing either `Good&apos; or `Bad!&apos;.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">la mutce bunbo mrenu bi ditca.\nla fumna bi le mrenu.\ndjan ga vedma le negro ketpi.\n#</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Good\nBad!\nGood</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=uva&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> uva </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
