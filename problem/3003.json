PuPu is a kind of special animal, infant PuPus play under the sunshine, and adult PuPus hunt near the seaside. They fell happy every day.<br><br>But there is a question, when does an infant PuPu become an adult PuPu?<br>Aha, we already said, PuPu is a special animal. There are several skins wraping PuPu&apos;s body, and PuPu&apos;s skins are special also, they have two states, clarity and opacity. The opacity skin will become clarity skin if it absorbs sunlight a whole day, and sunshine can pass through the clarity skin and shine the inside skin; The clarity skin will become opacity, if it absorbs sunlight a whole day, and opacity skin will keep sunshine out.<br><br>when an infant PuPu was born, all of its skins were opacity, and since the day that all of a PuPu&apos;s skins has been changed from opacity to clarity, PuPu is an adult PuPu.<br><br>For example, a PuPu who has only 3 skins will become an adult PuPu after it born 5 days(What a pity! The little guy will sustain the pressure from life only 5 days old)<br><br>Now give you the number of skins belongs to a new-laid PuPu, tell me how many days later it will become an adult PuPu?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are many testcase, each testcase only contains one integer N, the number of skins, process until N equals 0","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"Maybe an infant PuPu with 20 skins need a million days to become an adult PuPu, so you should output the result mod N","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n3\n0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2009+Multi-University+Training+Contest+11+-+Host+by+HRBEU&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2009 Multi-University Training Contest 11 - Host by HRBEU </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
