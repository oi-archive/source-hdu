And now another wave of monsters is coming and you need again to know whether you can get through it.<br><br>   The path of monsters is a straight line, and there are N blocks on it (numbered from 1 to N continuously). Before enemies come, you have M towers built. Each tower has an attack range [L, R], meaning that it can attack all enemies in every block i, where L&lt;=i&lt;=R. Once a monster steps into block i, every tower whose attack range include block i will attack the monster once and only once. For example, a tower with attack range [1, 3] will attack a monster three times if the monster is alive, one in block 1, another in block 2 and the last in block 3.<br><br>   A witch helps your enemies and makes every monster has its own place of appearance (the ith monster appears at block Xi). All monsters go straightly to block N.<br><br>   Now that you know each monster has HP Hi and each tower has a value of attack Di, one attack will cause Di damage (decrease HP by Di). If the HP of a monster is decreased to 0 or below 0, it will die and disappear.<br>Your task is to calculate the number of monsters surviving from your towers so as to make a plan B.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The input contains multiple test cases.<br><br>   The first line of each case is an integer N (0 &lt; N &lt;= 100000), the number of blocks in the path. The second line is an integer M (0 &lt; M &lt;= 100000), the number of towers you have. The next M lines each contain three numbers, Li, Ri, Di (1 &lt;= Li &lt;= Ri &lt;= N, 0 &lt; Di &lt;= 1000), indicating the attack range [L, R] and the value of attack D of the ith tower. The next line is an integer K (0 &lt; K &lt;= 100000), the number of coming monsters. The following K lines each contain two integers Hi and Xi (0 &lt; Hi &lt;= 10^18, 1 &lt;= Xi &lt;= N) indicating the ith monster&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s live point and the number of the block where the ith monster appears.<br><br>   The input is terminated by N = 0.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"   Output one line containing the number of surviving monsters.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5\n2\n1 3 1\n5 5 2\n5\n1 3\n3 1\n5 2\n7 3\n9 1\n0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>In the sample, three monsters with origin HP 5, 7 and 9 will survive.</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"SYSU","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2014+Multi-University+Training+Contest+9&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2014 Multi-University Training Contest 9 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
