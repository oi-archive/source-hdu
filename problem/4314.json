They are not tall enough to climb out of the well, so they want to make a human-pyramid, that is, one dwarf stands on another&apos;s shoulder, until the dwarf on the top can reach the top of the well when he raise his arms up. More precisely speaking, we know the i-th dwarf&apos;s height from feet to shoulder is Ai, and his arm length Bi. And we know the height of the well is H. If we can build a dwarf-tower consists of dwarf 1, dwarf 2, ..., dwarf k from bottom to top, such that A1 + A2 + ... + Ak-1 + Ak + Bk &gt;= H, then dwarf k can escape from the well. Obviously, the escaped dwarf can&apos;t be used to build tower again.<br><br>We want the escaped dwarfs as many as possible. Please write a program to help the dwarfs.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of each test case contains N, (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 2000) the number of trapped dwarfs.
