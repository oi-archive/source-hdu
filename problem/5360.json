The $i$-th soda will go hiking if the total number of soda that go hiking except him is no less than $l_i$ and no larger than $r_i$. beta will follow the rules below to invite soda one by one:<br>  1. he selects a soda not invited before;<br>  2. he tells soda the number of soda who agree to go hiking by now;<br>  3. soda will agree or disagree according to the number he hears.<br><br>Note: beta will always tell the truth and soda will agree if and only if the number he hears is no less than $l_i$ and no larger than $r_i$, otherwise he will disagree. Once soda agrees to go hiking he will not regret even if the final total number fails to meet some soda&apos;s will.<br><br>Help beta design an invitation order that the number of soda who agree to go hiking is maximum.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
