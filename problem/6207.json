After hearing a rumor that robots reaching his surface become human, he decides to escape. When he does, he transform into an organic human being. To distinguish him from other bombermen, our main character is given the name White Bomber. However another bomberman, known as Black Bomber is an enemy due to a programming error, trying to destroy the entire map.<br>A two dimensional lattice with a coefficient $H~(4\\le H\\le 100)$ describes the map. All pairs of integers $(x,y)$ satisfying $x+y=H$ or $x+y=H+1$ but $(0,H+1),(0,-H-1),(H+1,0)$ and $(-H-1,0)$ make up the range. Were a bomb deployed at a grid $(x,y)$ by Black Bomber, all grids around it would disappear, including $(x-1,y-1)$, $(x-1,y)$, $(x-1,y+1)$, $(x,y-1)$, $(x,y)$, $(x,y+1)$, $(x+1,y-1)$, $(x+1,y)$ and $(x+1,y+1)$ if exist.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C778-1002-1.jpg\"></center><br>The location of the bomb is an uniformly random every time when Black Bomber deploys it, but bombs can not be placed at disappeared grids. Black Bomber deploys a bomb and ignites it, then deploys anothor bomb and ignites it again. He stops if the whole map has been destroyed. Help White Bomber calculate the expected number of bombs which would be deployed by Black Bomber. Furthermore, if White Bomber has discovered the first grid which Black Bomber would select, what is the expected number of bombs that would be deployed.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is an integer $T~(1\\le 100\\le T)$ which is the number of test cases.<br>For each test case, there is a line containing an integer $H~(4\\le H\\le 100)$.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output two lines.<br>The first contains the the expected number of bombs deployed with the precision of $6$ digits.<br>The second line contains expected numbers if the first grid has been confirmed.<br>Output $8H$ floats numbers with $6$ places in a line corresponding to all grids in the clockwise direction and the first one indicates the situation of the top position $(0,H)$.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n4\n5</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">9.242411\n9.138479 9.441946 9.066139 9.078795 9.627045 9.078795 9.066139 9.441946 9.138479 9.441946 9.066139 9.078795 9.627045 9.078795 9.066139 9.441946 9.138479 9.441946 9.066139 9.078795 9.627045 9.078795 9.066139 9.441946 9.138479 9.441946 9.066139 9.078795 9.627045 9.078795 9.066139 9.441946 \n11.430268\n11.321153 11.580865 11.323971 11.357984 11.562263 11.331363 11.562263 11.357984 11.323971 11.580865 11.321153 11.580865 11.323971 11.357984 11.562263 11.331363 11.562263 11.357984 11.323971 11.580865 11.321153 11.580865 11.323971 11.357984 11.562263 11.331363 11.562263 11.357984 11.323971 11.580865 11.321153 11.580865 11.323971 11.357984 11.562263 11.331363 11.562263 11.357984 11.323971 11.580865 </div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2017+ACM%2FICPC+Asia+Regional+Qingdao+Online&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2017 ACM/ICPC Asia Regional Qingdao Online </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
