He likes to design math games for himself to play. One day, he defined that &#x201C;a positive integer u is under good relation with another positive integer $v$&#x201D; if the set of all prime factors of $u$ and the set of all prime factors of $v$ are the same. For example, 6 is under good relation with 12, since the set of all prime factors of both 6 and 12 are the same.<br><br>Now he has a number $k$, he tries to find all numbers that are under good relation with $k$. However, he then unfortunately discovers the fact that there are infinite integers which satisfy this condition. Therefore, Kyrie defines: For a positive integer $n$, if there exist an integer $T$ that satisfies $n &#xB7; T = k$ and $n$ is under good relation with $k$ at the same time, then he will say &#x201C;$n$ is good.&#x201D;<br><br>Kyrie is now very happy seeing that there are only finite &#x201C;good numbers&#x201D; no matter what the value of k is. He decides to invite his friend Erik to play the math game together. They pick $k_1$ and $k_2$ and try to find their own &#x201C;good number&#x201D; accordingly. Assume there is a surprising miracle that $k_1$ and $k_2$ have the same greatest prime factor, and what&#x2019;s more, second large prime factor of $k_1$ is not a factor of $k_2$ and the second large prime factor of $k_2$ is also not a factor of $k_1$.<br><br>Write a program to find out how many &#x201C;good number&#x201D; there are under $k_1$ and $k_2$.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line on the input contains an integer $T (T \\leq 10)$.
