One day, when he was doing on a least common multiple(LCM) problem, he suddenly thought of a very interesting question: if given a number of S, and we divided S into some numbers , then what is the largest LCM of these numbers? partychen thought this problems for a long time but with no result, so he turned to you for help!<br>Since the answer can very big,you should give the answer modulo M.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are many groups of test case.On each test case only two integers S( 0 &lt; S &lt;= 3000) and M( 2&lt;=M&lt;=10000) as mentioned above.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"Output the largest LCM modulo M of given S.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">6 23</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">6\n\n\nHint: you can divied 6 as 1+2+3 and the LCM(1,2,3)=6 is the largest so we output 6%23=6.</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2009+Multi-University+Training+Contest+18+-+Host+by+ECNU+&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2009 Multi-University Training Contest 18 - Host by ECNU  </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
