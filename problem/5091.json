Each planet is warring for resources. In the Star Wars, Planet X is under attack by other planets. Now, a large wave of enemy spaceships is approaching. There is a very large Beam Cannon on the Planet X, and it is very powerful, which can destroy all the spaceships in its attack range in a second. However, it takes a long time to fill the energy of the Beam Cannon after each shot. So, you should make sure each shot can destroy the enemy spaceships as many as possible.<br>   <br>   To simplify the problem, the Beam Cannon can shot at any area in the space, and the attack area is rectangular. The rectangle parallels to the coordinate axes and cannot rotate. It can only move horizontally or vertically. The enemy spaceship in the space can be considered as a point projected to the attack plane. If the point is in the rectangular attack area of the Beam Cannon(including border), the spaceship will be destroyed.
