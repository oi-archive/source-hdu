Here are nine of them: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Eve, Frank, Gloria, Henry and Irene. <br><br>Mike is so skillful that he can master $n$ languages (aka. programming languages).<br><br>His nine friends are all weaker than he. The sets they can master are all subsets of Mike&apos;s languages.<br><br>But the relations between the nine friends is very complex. Here are some clues.<br><br>1. Alice is a nice girl, so her subset is a superset of Bob&apos;s.<br>2. Bob is a naughty boy, so his subset is a superset of Carol&apos;s.<br>3. Dave is a handsome boy, so his subset is a superset of Eve&apos;s.<br>4. Eve is an evil girl, so her subset is a superset of Frank&apos;s.<br>5. Gloria is a cute girl, so her subset is a superset of Henry&apos;s.<br>6. Henry is a tall boy, so his subset is a superset of Irene&apos;s.<br>7.
