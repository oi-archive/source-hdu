Named after their inventors, Adelson-Velskii and Landis, they were the first dynamically balanced trees to be proposed. Like red-black trees, they are not perfectly balanced, but pairs of sub-trees differ in height by at most 1, maintaining an O(logn) search time. Addition and deletion operations also take O(logn) time. <br>Definition of an AVL tree <br>An AVL tree is a binary search tree which has the following properties: <br>1. The sub-trees of every node differ in height by at most one. <br>2. Every sub-tree is an AVL tree.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C128-1002-1.jpg\"></center><br>Balance requirement for an AVL tree: the left and right sub-trees differ by at most 1 in height.An AVL tree of n nodes can have different height.<br>For example, n = 7:<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C128-1002-2.jpg\"></center><br>So the maximal height of the AVL Tree with 7 nodes is 3.<br>Given n,the number of vertices, you are to calculate the maximal hight of the AVL tree with n nodes.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Input file contains multiple test cases.
