This changed the rate of tax Ontarians pay on various items.<br><br>Dalton would like to calculate how this change will affect his personal monthly budget.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a single integer, the number of test cases to follow. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers N, M, the number of categories of items and the number of purchases Dalton makes each month, respectively. Each of these integers is between 1 and 100000, inclusive. N lines follow, each describing a category of item. Each of these lines contains a category name, which is a string of at most 30 uppercase letters, followed by three percentages, giving the PST, GST, and HST rate on that category. Each percentage is a number with up to two digits after the decimal point, and each percentage is followed by the % symbol. Each percentage is at least 0% and at most 100%. These lines are followed by M more lines, each describing one of Dalton&apos;s purchases. Each of these lines contains a category name and a price in dollars and cents and prefixed by the $ symbol. Each such line indicates the amount of pre-tax money that Dalton spends on an item in the specified category. The amount of each tax to be paid on an item is rounded to the nearest cent; if the tax amount is exactly half a cent more than a whole number of cents, it is rounded up to the nearest greater whole number of cents.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output the difference, in dollars and cents, between the total HST payable and the total sum of PST and GST payable on Dalton&apos;s monthly purchases.
