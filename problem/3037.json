They need plenty of food to get through those long cold days. After some time the squirrel family thinks that they have to solve a problem. They suppose that they will save beans in n different trees. However, since the food is not sufficient nowadays, they will get no more than m beans. They want to know that how many ways there are to save no more than m beans (they are the same) in n trees.<br><br>Now they turn to you for help, you should give them the answer. The result may be extremely huge; you should output the result modulo p, because squirrels can&#x2019;t recognize large numbers.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains one integer T, means the number of cases.<br><br>Then followed T lines, each line contains three integers n, m, p, means that squirrels will save no more than m same beans in n different trees, 1 &lt;= n, m &lt;= 1000000000, 1 &lt; p &lt; 100000 and p is guaranteed to be a prime.

Since trees are different, we can label them as 1, 2 &#x2026; and so on. \nThe 3 ways are: put no beans, put 1 bean in tree 1 and put 2 beans in tree 1.
