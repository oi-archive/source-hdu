He knows that there are n groups of people (groups are labeled from 0 to n - 1) and m seats around the table (seats are labeled from 0 to m - 1) in the conference. There are a<sub>i</sub> people in the i-th group. They should be assigned seats within range (l<sub>i</sub>, (l<sub>i</sub> + 1)%m, (l<sub>i</sub>+ 2)%m, . . . , r<sub>i</sub>).In a valid arrangment, everyone has a single seat, and no seat can be shared by more than one person. Zero wants to know whether such an arrangement exists.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   There are several test cases.
