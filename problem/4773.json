In his noted work Epaphai, he posed and solved such a problem: constructing circles that are tangent to three given circles in a plane. Two tangent circles can be internally or externally tangent to each other, thus Apollonius&apos;s problem generically have eight solutions. <br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Now considering a simplified case of Apollonius&apos;s problem: constructing circles that are externally tangent to two given circles, and touches a given point(the given point must be on the circle which you find, can&apos;t be inside the circle). In addition, two given circles have no common points, and neither of them are contained by the other, and the given point is also located strictly outside the given circles. You should be thankful that modern mathematics provides you with plenty of useful tools other than euclidean geometry that help you a lot in this problem.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;The first line of input contains an integer T (T &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 200), indicating the number of cases.<br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Each ease has eight positive integers x1, y1, r1, x2, y2, r2, x3, y3 in a single line, stating two circles whose centres are (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and radius are r1 and r2 respectively, and a point located at (x3, y3).
