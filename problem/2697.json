As we all know, a beautiful balloon will appears when a  <br>problem is solved. Alex loves balloons, especially when they&apos;re in a consecutive column, from which he can get a sense of  <br>accomplishment. <br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/2697.jpg\"> <br>Problems on WOJ have a variety of difficulties. Hard problems cost more time, while easy ones may be &quot;killed in 1  <br>second&quot;. Now we know that WOJ has N problems, numbered from 1 to N. Alex calls the solved problems in one  <br>consecutive column as a &quot;successful string&quot;. The length of a successful string is the number of problems it contains. Also  <br>he defines the value of a successful string as the square of the string&apos;s length. Alex hopes to solve a certain number of  <br>problems in M time, so he can get some successful strings, now he wants to maximize the sum of all the strings&apos; value.
