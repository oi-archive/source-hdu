For a long period, he went to office with the shortest path because he loves to sleep late&#x2026;Time goes by, he find that he should have some changes as you could see, always riding with the same path is boring.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;One day, oooccc1 got an idea! Why could I take another path? Tired at all the tasks he got, he got no time to carry it out. As a best friend of his, you&#x2019;re going to help him!<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Since oooccc1 is now getting up earlier, he is glad to take those paths, which are a little longer than the shortest one. To be precisely, you are going to find all the second shortest paths.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;You would be given a directed graph G, together with the start point S which stands for oooccc&#x2019;1 his house and target point E presents his office. And there is no cycle in the graph. Your task is to tell him how long are these paths and how many there are.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are some cases.
