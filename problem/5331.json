Yuta is worrying about this situation. He&apos;s given Rikka many math tasks to practice but she hasn&apos;t solved any of them. So, today he comes up with a simple problem to help her build up confidence:<br><br>Here is a tree with $m$ nodes, you can delete some of the nodes on the tree and there mustn&apos;t be any edges connecting two remained nodes. You need to maximize the number of the points remained.<br><br>Rikka thinks this task is too simple, so she comes up with a new problem:<br><br>At first there is a tree with only one node. And then each time she links a new node to the tree. After each operation, you need to tell her the maximum number of the points remained (as described above).<br><br>This problem is too difficult for Rikka to solve. Can you help her?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are no more than 100 testcases and there are no more than 3 testcases with $n &gt; 10^3$. <br><br>For each testcase, the first line contains a number $n\\ (1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5)$.<br><br>Then $n-1$ lines follow.
