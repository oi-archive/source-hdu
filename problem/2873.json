This game is played on an n*m chessboard. A pair of integers (p, q) represents the grid at row p, column q. Some bombs were placed on the chessboard at the beginning. Every round, a player can choose to explode a bomb located at (p, q), and the exploded bomb will disappear. Furthermore:<br><br>      1.If p&gt;1 and q&gt;1, the bomb will split up into two bombs located at (u, q) and (p, v), u&lt;p, v&lt;q, u and v are chosen by the player.<br>      2.If p=1 and q&gt;1, one new bomb will be produced, located at (p, v), v&lt;q, v can be chosen freely by the player.<br>      3.If q=1 and p&gt;1, one new bomb will be produced, located at (u, q), u&lt;p, u can be chosen freely by the player.<br><br><br>If two bombs located at the same position or a bomb located at (1, 1), they will be exploded automatically without producing new bombs.<br>Two players play in turn, until one player cannot explode the bombs and loses the game.<br>John always plays first.<br>Now, we&#x2019;ll give you an initial situation, and you should tell us who will win at last. Assume John and Jack are smart enough, and they always do the best choice.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases, each one begins with two integers n and m, 0&lt;n, m&lt;=50, represents the number of rows and columns.
