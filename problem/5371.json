Now she is playing with N-sequence.<br>Let&apos;s define N-sequence, which is composed with three parts and satisfied with the following condition:<br>1. the first part is the same as the thrid part,<br>2. the first part and the second part are symmetrical.<br>for example, the sequence 2,3,4,4,3,2,2,3,4 is a N-sequence, which the first part 2,3,4 is the same as the thrid part 2,3,4, the first part 2,3,4 and the second part 4,3,2 are symmetrical.<br><br>Give you n positive intergers, your task is to find the largest continuous sub-sequence, which is N-sequence.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
