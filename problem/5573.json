According to the law, each node should connect to exactly two nodes on the next level, forming a full binary tree.<br><br>Since the king is professional in math, he sets a number to each node. Specifically, the root of the tree, where the King lives, is $1$. Say $f_{root} = 1$.<br><br>And for each node $u$, labels as $f_u$, the left child is $f_u \\times 2$ and right child is $f_u \\times 2 + 1$. The king looks at his tree kingdom, and feels satisfied.<br><br>Time flies, and the frog king gets sick. According to the old dark magic, there is a way for the king to live for another $N$ years, only if he could collect exactly $N$ soul gems.<br><br>Initially the king has zero soul gems, and he is now at the root. He will walk down, choosing left or right child to continue. Each time at node $x$, the number at the node is $f_x$ (remember $f_{root} = 1$), he can choose to increase his number of soul gem by $f_x$, or decrease it by $f_x$.<br><br>He will walk from the root, visit exactly $K$ nodes (including the root), and do the increasement or decreasement as told. If at last the number is $N$, then he will succeed.<br><br>Noting as the soul gem is some kind of magic, the number of soul gems the king has could be negative.<br><br>Given $N$, $K$, help the King find a way to collect exactly $N$ soul gems by visiting exactly $K$ nodes.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"First line contains an integer $T$, which indicates the number of test cases.<br><br>Every test case contains two integers $N$ and $K$, which indicates soul gems the frog king want to collect and number of nodes he can visit.<br><br>$\\cdot$ $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$.<br><br>$\\cdot$ $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^9$.<br><br>$\\cdot$ $N \\leq 2^K \\leq 2^{60}$.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For every test case, you should output &quot;<b>Case #x:</b>&quot; first, where $x$ indicates the case number and counts from $1$.<br><br>Then $K$ lines follows, each line is formated as &apos;a b&apos;, where $a$ is node label of the node the frog visited, and $b$ is either &apos;+&apos; or &apos;-&apos; which means he increases / decreases his number by $a$.<br><br>It&apos;s guaranteed that there are at least one solution and if there are more than one solutions, you can output any of them.<br><br>","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n5 3\n10 4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1:\n1 +\n3 -\n7 +\nCase #2:\n1 +\n3 +\n6 -\n12 +</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2015ACM%2FICPC%D1%C7%D6%DE%C7%F8%C9%CF%BA%A3%D5%BE-%D6%D8%CF%D6%C8%FC%A3%A8%B8%D0%D0%BB%BB%AA%B6%AB%C0%ED%B9%A4%A3%A9&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2015ACM/ICPC&#x4E9A;&#x6D32;&#x533A;&#x4E0A;&#x6D77;&#x7AD9;-&#x91CD;&#x73B0;&#x8D5B;&#xFF08;&#x611F;&#x8C22;&#x534E;&#x4E1C;&#x7406;&#x5DE5;&#xFF09; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
