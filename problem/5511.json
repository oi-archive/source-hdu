Let $T$ be a spanning tree of $G$. We say that a cut in G two-respects $T$ if and only if it <b>cuts just two edges of</b> $T$.<br><br>Since love needs good faith and hypocrisy return for only grief, you should find the minimum cut of graph $G$ two-respecting given spanning tree $T$. To simplify the problem, we guarantee that for each edge $(u,v)\\not\\in T$ in graph $G$, the unique path in $T$ between $u$ and $v$ must pass through the node $1$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases.<br>The first line of the input is a single integer $t~(1\\le t\\le 25)$ which is the number of test cases.<br>Then $t$ test cases follow.<br><br>Each test case contains several lines.<br>The first line contains the integer $n~(3\\le n\\le 20000)$ and the integer $m~(n-1\\le m\\le 100000)$.<br>The following $n-1$ lines describe the spanning tree $T$ and each of them contains two integers $u$ and $v$ corresponding to an edge.<br>The following $m-n+1$ lines describe the undirected graph $G$ and each of them contains two integers $u$ and $v$ corresponding to an edge which is no in the spanning tree.<br><br>The sum of $m$ for all test cases would not be larger than $500000$.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, you should output the minimum cut of graph $G$ two-respecting given spanning tree $T$.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n\n8 14\n1 2\n2 3\n1 4\n4 5\n1 6\n6 7\n6 8\n3 4\n2 5\n5 7\n1 7\n2 6\n2 8\n3 8\n\n4 6\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 3\n3 4\n4 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 3\nCase #2: 4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2015ACM%2FICPC%D1%C7%D6%DE%C7%F8%C9%F2%D1%F4%D5%BE-%D6%D8%CF%D6%C8%FC%A3%A8%B8%D0%D0%BB%B6%AB%B1%B1%B4%F3%D1%A7%A3%A9&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2015ACM/ICPC&#x4E9A;&#x6D32;&#x533A;&#x6C88;&#x9633;&#x7AD9;-&#x91CD;&#x73B0;&#x8D5B;&#xFF08;&#x611F;&#x8C22;&#x4E1C;&#x5317;&#x5927;&#x5B66;&#xFF09; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
