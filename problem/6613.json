The squirrel hides at a node of a tree, while its owner `eom` has no idea which node it hides at. As a magician, `eom` can choose a node and release many magical creatures to search his squirrel in all directions at the speed of 1. Besides, he can choose a pair of adjacent nodes on the tree and reduce the distance between them to 0 before releasing magical creatures. Please help him to find the start node to release magical creatures, so that `eom` can find his squirrel in the shortest time even in the worst condition. Note that `eom` is full of wisdom, so that he can optimally make decision to reduce the distance after the start node is determined.
