You need to choose a temperature for the greenhouse based on these information, providing Lotus with the maximum research value.<br><br>__NOTICE: the temperature can be any real number.__<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input includes multiple test cases.
