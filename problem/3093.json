V voters attend the election, each casting their vote for one of N political parties. Mofficials will be elected into the parliament.<br>The conversion from votes to parliament seats is done using the D&apos;Hondt method with a 5% threshold.More precisely, suppose that the parties are numbered 1 through N and that they receive V1, V2, ..., VN votes. Parliament seats are allocated as follows:<br>1. All parties that receive strictly less than 5% of V votes are erased from the list of parties.<br>2. The parliament is initially empty i.e. every party has zero seats allocated.<br>3. For each party P, the quotient QP=VP/(SP+1) is calculated, where VP is the total number of votes received by party P, and SP is the number of seats already allocated to party P.<br>4. The party with the largest quotient QP is allocated one seat. If multiple parties have the same largest quotient, the lower numbered party wins the seat.<br>5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the parliament is full.<br>The votes are being counted and only part of the V votes has been tallied. It is known how many votes each party has received so far.Write a program that calculates for each party, among all possible outcomes of the election after all V votes are counted, the largest and smallest number of seats the party wins.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains the integers V, N and M (1 &#x2264; V &#x2264; 10,000,000, 1 &#x2264; N &#x2264; 100, 1 &#x2264; M &#x2264; 200), the numbers of votes, parties and seats in the parliament.<br>The second line contains N integers &#x2013; how many votes (of those that have been counted) each party got.

To illustrate one possible outcome, suppose that the first party receives 2 of those 6 votes, \nthe second none, the third 1 vote and the fourth 3 votes. The parties&apos; totals are 6, 3, 7 and 4 votes. All parties exceeded the 5% threshold.\nSeats are allocated as follows:\n1. The quotients are initially 6/1, 3/1, 7/1 and 4/1; the largest is 7/1 so party 3 wins a seat.\n2. The quotients are 6/1, 3/1, 7/2 and 4/1; the largest is 6/1 so party 1 wins a seat.\n3. The quotients are 6/2, 3/1, 7/2 and 4/1; the largest is 4/1 so party 4 wins a seat.\n4. The quotients are 6/2, 3/1, 7/2 and 4/2; the largest is 7/2 so party 3 wins a seat.\n5. The quotients are 6/2, 3/1, 7/3 and 4/2; parties 1 and 2 are tied with quotients 6/2 and 3/1,but party 1 is lower numbered so it wins the last seat.\n\nIn this outcome, the numbers of seats won by the parties are 2, 0, 2 and 1. Since it is possible for the second party not to win any seats, the second number\n on the second line of output is zero.\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2009+Multi-University+Training+Contest+18+-+Host+by+ECNU+&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2009 Multi-University Training Contest 18 - Host by ECNU  </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
