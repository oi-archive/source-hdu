Now the head of state decide to reward him with honor and treasures for his great exploit. <br><br>One of these treasures is a necklace made up of 26 different kinds of gemstones, and the length of the necklace is n. (That is to say: n gemstones are stringed together to constitute this necklace, and each of these gemstones belongs to only one of the 26 kinds.) <br><br>In accordance with the classical view, a necklace is valuable if and only if it is a palindrome - the necklace looks the same in either direction. However, the necklace we mentioned above may not a palindrome at the beginning. So the head of state decide to cut the necklace into two part, and then give both of them to General Li. <br><br>All gemstones of the same kind has the same value (may be positive or negative because of their quality - some kinds are beautiful while some others may looks just like normal stones). A necklace that is palindrom has value equal to the sum of its gemstones&apos; value. while a necklace that is not palindrom has value zero. <br><br>Now the problem is: how to cut the given necklace so that the sum of the two necklaces&apos;s value is greatest. Output this value. <br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input is a single integer T (1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; T &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 10) - the number of test cases.
