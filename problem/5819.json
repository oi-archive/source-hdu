The knights are numbered from 1 to N, and the ith knight stands i unit from the left end of the road.<br><br>When the game begins, each knight moves to left or right at the same speed. Whenever a knight reaches to the end of the road, he instantly changes his direction. <br><br>Whenever two knights meet, they fight until one loses, where each one of them wins in 50% possibility. Then the winner keeps moving in the direction he was moving before the fight, and the loser quits the game. The fighting time is very short and can be ignored.<br><br>The game continues until only one knight remains, and that knight is the winner.<br><br>Now, we know the moving direction of each knight initially. Can you calculate the possibility that Nth knight win the game?<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input gives the number of test cases T (T &lt;= 10).
