For instance, xyz100 precedes xyz2. In some applications such as listing files, normal order sort may be used where any string of digits in a character string is treated as a single digit with numerical value given by the digit string. For example, the following are in normal order:<br><br>XYZ001, XYZ2, XYZ003, XYZ08, XYZ23, XYZ100, XYZQ<br><br>We wish to extend normal order sort in two ways:<br><br>1. Lower case and upper case letters sort the same (with the upper case value).<br><br>2. If a plus (+) or minus (-) sign precedes a digit and does not follow a digit, it is considered part of the following number for sorting purposes.<br><br>So 123+456+7890 are three numbers separated by plus signs but A+003 is the same as A3.<br><br>To do our sort, we will use a library sort routine but we need to furnish a comparison routine. Write a comparison routine which takes as input two strings of printable, non-space ASCII characters (chr(33)-chr(126)) and returns:<br><br>-1 if the first string should precede the second in extended normal order<br>0 it the two strings are the same in extended normal order, or<br>1 if the first string should follow the second in extended normal order.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a single integer N, (1 &#x2264; N &#x2264; 1000) which is the number of data sets that follow.
