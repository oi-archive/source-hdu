A bit string has even parity if the number of 1&apos;s is even.Zero is considered to be an even number, so a bit string with no 1&apos;s has even parity. Note that the number of<br>0&apos;s does not affect the parity of a bit string.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of one or more strings, each on a line by itself, followed by a line containing only &quot;#&quot; that signals the end of the input.
