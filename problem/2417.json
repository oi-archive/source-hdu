The sides of the squares are integer numbers. We locate the squares on the positive x-y quarter of the plane, such that their sides make 45 degrees with x and y axes, and one of their vertices are on y=0 line. Let b<sub>i</sub> be the x coordinates of the bottom vertex of S<sub>i</sub>. First, put S<sub>1</sub> such that its left vertex lies on x=0. Then, put S<sub>1</sub>, (i &gt; 1) at minimum b<sub>i</sub> such that <br><br>b<sub>i</sub> &gt; b<sub>i-1</sub> and<br>the interior of S<sub>i</sub> does not have intersection with the interior of S<sub>1</sub>...S<sub>i-1</sub>.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C152-1009-1.jpg\"></center><br>The goal is to find which squares are visible, either entirely or partially, when viewed from above. In the example above, the squares S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, and S<sub>4</sub> have this property. More formally, S<sub>i</sub> is visible from above if it contains a point p, such that no square other than S<sub>i</sub> intersect the vertical half-line drawn from p upwards. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of multiple test cases.
