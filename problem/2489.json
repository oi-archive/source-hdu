The first line of each test case contains two integers n (2&lt;=n&lt;=15) and m (2&lt;=m&lt;=n), which stands for the number of nodes in the graph and the number of nodes in the minimal ratio tree. Two zeros end the input. The next line contains n numbers which stand for the weight of each node. The following n lines contain a diagonally symmetrical n&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;n connectivity matrix with each element shows the weight of the edge connecting one node with another. Of course, the diagonal will be all 0, since there is no edge connecting a node with itself.<br><br><br><br>All the weights of both nodes and edges (except for the ones on the diagonal of the matrix) are integers and in the range of [1, 100].<br><br>The figure below illustrates the first test case in sample input.

Nodes should be arranged in ascending order. If there are several such sequences, pick the one which has the smallest node number; if there&apos;s a tie, look at the second smallest node number, etc. Please note that the nodes are numbered from 1 .
