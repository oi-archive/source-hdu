But her brain doesn&apos;t work well that she can&apos;t find the volume of complex parts. So she needs your help.<br><br>To simplify the problem, the part is made up of cubes with side length $1$, and the vertices of these cubes are all on the grid. Give you three 0/1 matrices, each representing each of the three views. $0$ means that there is no projection of cubes at this position of the view; $1$ means that there is a projection of cubes at this position of the view.<br><br>Now Keke wants you to help her find the volume of the part determined by the three views.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are mutiple test cases, the number of which is no more than 10. For each test case:<br><br>The first line of input contains three integers $ m_x, m_y, m_z (1\\leq m_x, m_y, m_z\\leq99)$ , which represent the coordinate range of all possible cubes (i.e. all possible cubes are in the cuboid area whose body diagonal is from $(1,1,1)$ to $(m_x, m_y, m_z)$).<br><br>Following input a 0/1 matrix with $m_x$ lines and $m_y$ columns representing the front view, and the $y$-th column of the $x$-th row represents the projection of all the cubes in the front view such as $(x, y, ?)$.<br><br>Following input a 0/1 matrix with $m_y$ lines and $m_z$ columns representing the side view, and the $z$-th column of the $y$-th row represents the projections of all the cubes in the side view such as $(?, y, z)$.<br><br>Following input a 0/1 matrix with $m_z$ lines and $m_x$ columns representing the top view, and the $x$-th column of the $z$-th row represents the projection of all the cubes of the top view such as $(x, ?, z)$.<br><br>The &apos;$?$&apos; in the above coordinates represents any integer. Numbers in the same line are separated by spaces.
