The orchard seems like an N * M two-dimensional map.  In each grid, I can either plant an apple tree to get one apple or fertilize the soil to speed up its neighbors&#x2019; production. When a grid is fertilized, the grid itself doesn&#x2019;t produce apples but the number of apples of its four neighbor trees will double (if it exists). For example, an apple tree locates on (x, y), and (x - 1, y), (x, y - 1) are fertilized while (x + 1, y), (x, y + 1) are not, then I can get four apples from (x, y). Now, I am wondering how many apples I can get at most in the whole orchard?<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The input contains multiple test cases.
