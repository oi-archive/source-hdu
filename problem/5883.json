In this valley, there are $N$ lakes, and $M$ rivers linking these lakes. Alice wants to start her trip from one lake, and enjoys the landscape by boat. That means she need to set up a path which go through every river exactly once. In addition, Alice has a specific number ($a_1, a_2, ... , a_n$) for each lake. If the path she finds is $P_0 \\rightarrow P_1 \\rightarrow ... \\rightarrow P_t$, the lucky number of this trip would be $a_{P_0} \\quad XOR \\quad a_{P_1} \\quad XOR \\quad... \\quad XOR \\quad a_{P_t}$. She want to make this number as large as possible. Can you help her?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains an integer $t$, the number of test cases. $t$ test cases follow.<br><br>For each test case, in the first line there are two positive integers $N~(N \\leq 100000)$ and $M~(M \\leq 500000)$, as described above.
