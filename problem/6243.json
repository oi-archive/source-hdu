He has $N$ dogs numbered $0, 1, ..., N-1$. He also has $N$ cages numbered $0, 1, ..., N-1$. Everyday he takes all his dogs out and walks them outside. When he is back home, as dogs can&#x2019;t recognize the numbers, each dog just randomly selects a cage and enters it. Each cage can hold only one dog.<br>One day, Jerry noticed that some dogs were in the cage with the same number of themselves while others were not. Jerry would like to know what&#x2019;s the expected number of dogs that are NOT in the cage with the same number of themselves.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ test cases follow.<br>Each test case contains only one number $N$, indicating the number of dogs and cages.<br>$1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5$<br>$1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one line containing &#x201C;Case #x: y&#x201D;, where $x$ is the test case number (starting from 1) and $y$ is the expected number of dogs that are NOT in the cage with the same number of itself.<br>$y$ will be considered correct if it is within an absolute or relative error of $10^{-6}$ of the correct answer.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n1\n2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 0.0000000000\nCase #2: 1.0000000000\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nIn the first test case, the only dog will enter the only cage.
