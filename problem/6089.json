Yuta is worrying about this situation, so he gives Rikka some math tasks to practice. There is one of them:<br><br>In an ancient country, there are $n \\times m$ cities. The coordinate of the $(x-1)m+y$th city is $(x,y)(1 \\leq x \\leq n,1 \\leq y \\leq m)$. There are $q$ tourists. Initially, the $i$th tourist is at city $(x_i,y_i)$ and all of them want to go out and play in other cities.<br><br>Unfortunately, $K$ of the $n \\times m$ cities has been controlled by terrorists, so these $K$ cities became unsafe. For safety, the tourist whose initial coordinate is $(x1,y1)$ can go to the city $(x2,y2)$ if and only if all of the city $(x,y)(\\min(x1,x2) \\leq x \\leq \\max(x1,x2),\\min(y1,y2) \\leq y \\leq \\max(y1,y2))$ is safe.<br><br>Now, for each tourist, Yuta wants to know the number of cities he can reach safely (including the initial city he stayed).<br><br>It is too difficult for Rikka. Can you help her?<br><br>In the sample, the third tourist can reach $(1,4),(2,4),(3,4),(4,4),(1,3),(2,3),(2,2),(2,1)$.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a number $t(1 \\leq t \\leq 100)$, the number of the testcases.
