The mathematician entered the cave because it is there. Somewhere deep in the cave, she found a treasure chest with a combination lock and some numbers on it. After quite a research, the mathematician found out that the correct combination to the lock would be obtained by calculating how many ways are there to pick $m$ different apples among $n$ of them and modulo it with $M$. $M$ is the product of several different primes.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"On the first line there is an integer $T (T \\leq 20)$ representing the number of test cases.<br><br>Each test case starts with three integers $n, m, k (1 \\leq m \\leq n \\leq 10^{18}, 1 \\leq k \\leq 10)$ on a line where $k$ is the number of primes.
