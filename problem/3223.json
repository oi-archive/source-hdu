Leon S. Kennedy, the secret agent of White House, goes to rescue her. He keeps in contact with Hunnigan, the president&apos;s secretary.<br><br>But the time in their contact log has been encrypted, using the following method:<br><br>Count the number of seconds from 2000.01.01 00:00:00 to that time, assume this number is x. Then calculate x<sup>q</sup>, modulo it by a prime number p. The remainder a is the encrypted number.<br><br>Your task is to help Leon write a program to decrypt the contact log, and tell him all the possible original time.<br><br>1. Remember that if the year can be divided evenly by 4 but can&apos;t be divided evenly by 100, or it can be divided evenly by 400, this year is a leap year. The February of a leap year has 29 days, while the February of other years has 28 days.<br><br>2. In this problem, if the year modulo 10 is 5 or 8, at the end of this year, there is one &#x201C;leap second&#x201D;, i.e., the second after 2005.12.31 23:59:59 is 2005.12.31 23:59:60, and after that second, it&apos;s 2006.01.01 00:00:00.<br>You may assume that from 2000.01.01 00:00:00 till that time, less than p seconds have passed.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.<br>The first line of the input contains an integer T, meaning the number of the test cases.<br><br>For each test case, a single line of three integers: p, q, and a.
