Here is their conversation:<br><br>Bob: It&apos;s unfair. I am always the second player, but you know, if the number of stones in each pile are distributed uniformly, at most time the first player, i.e., you, will win.<br>Alice: Yes, I agree with you. So I give you a chance to beat me, you are allowed to add some stones in some piles (but you can&apos;t create a new pile) before the game starts, so that you can win as the second player.<br>Bob: Yeah, that&apos;s cool. I will win definitely.<br>Alice: But note, you must add the minimum of the stones. If you add more stones than necessary to win, your winning will be cancelled.<br>Bob: er... Let me see...<br><br>For the readers who are not familiar with the Nim game (from Wikipedia):<br>Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing stones from distinct heaps. On each turn, a player must remove at least one stone, and may remove any number of stones provided they all come from the same heap. The player who take the last stone wins.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of each test case contains an integer N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10), the number of piles at the beginning.
