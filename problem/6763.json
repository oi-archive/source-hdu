These cities are labeled by $1,2,\\dots,n$, the brightness of the $i$-th city is $b_i$.<br><br>Magician Sunset wants to play a joke on Byteland by making a total eclipse such that the brightness of every city becomes zero. Sunset can do the following operations for arbitrary number of times:<br><br>&#xB7; Select an integer $k$ ($1\\leq k\\leq n$).<br><br>&#xB7; Select $k$ distinct cities $c_1,c_2,\\dots,c_k$ ($1\\leq c_i\\leq n$) such that they are connected with each other. In other words, for every pair of distinct selected cities $c_i$ and $c_j$ $(1\\leq i&lt;j\\leq k)$, if you are at city $c_i$, you can reach city $c_j$ without visiting cities not in $\\{c_1,c_2,\\dots,c_k\\}$.<br><br>&#xB7; For every selected city $c_i$ ($1\\leq i\\leq k$), decrease $b_{c_i}$ by $1$.<br><br>Note that Sunset will always choose $k$ with the maximum possible value. Now Sunset is wondering what is the minimum number of operations he needs to do, please write a program to help him.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \\leq T \\leq 10$), the number of test cases.<br><br>For each case, the first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 100\\,000$, $1\\leq m\\leq 200\\,000$), denoting the number of cities and the number of roads.<br><br>The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $b_1,b_2,\\dots,b_n$ ($1\\leq b_i\\leq 10^9$), denoting the brightness of each city.<br><br>Each of the following $m$ lines contains two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$ ($1\\leq u_i,v_i\\leq n,u_i\\neq v_i$), denoting an bidirectional road between the $u_i$-th city and the $v_i$-th city.
