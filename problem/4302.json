It lives in a straight pipe whose length is L. Holedox can only move along the pipe. Cakes may appear anywhere in the pipe, from time to time.

If there are no cakes present, Holedox just stays where it is.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases.
