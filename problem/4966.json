That is because you don&apos;t know its full name---&apos;Good Good Study and Day Day Up!&quot;. Very famous sentence! Isn&apos;t it?<br><br>   Now &quot;GGS-DDU&quot; is lzqxh&apos;s target! He has N courses and every course is divided into a plurality of levels. Just like College English have Level 4 and Level 6.<br><br>   To simplify the problem, we suppose that the i-th course has Levels from level 0 to level a[i]. And at the beginning, lzqxh is at Level 0 of every course. Because his target is &quot;GGS-DDU&quot;, lzqxh wants to reach the highest Level of every course. <br><br>   Fortunately, there are M tutorial classes. The i-th tutoial class requires that students must reach at least Level L1[i] of course c[i] before class begins. And after finishing the i-th tutorial class, the students will reach Level L2[i] of course d[i]. The i-th tutoial class costs lzqxh money[i]. <br><br>   For example, there is a tutorial class only students who reach at least Level 5 of &quot;Tiyu&quot; can apply. And after finishing this class, the student&apos;s &quot;MeiShu&quot; will reach Level 10 if his &quot;MeiShu&quot;&apos;s Level is lower than 10. (Don&apos;t ask me why! Supernatural class!!!&quot;)<br><br>   Now you task is to help lzqxh to compute the minimum cost!","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The input contains multiple test cases.<br><br>   The first line of each case consists of two integers, N (N&lt;=50) and M (M&lt;=2000). <br>   The following line contains N integers, representing a[1] to a[N]. The sum of a[1] to a[N] will not exceed 500. <br>   The next M lines, each have five integers, indicating c[i], L1[i], d[i], L2[i] and money[i] (1&lt;=c[i], d[i]&lt;=N, 0&lt;=L1[i]&lt;=a[c[i]], 0&lt;=L2[i]&lt;=a[d[i]], money[i]&lt;=1000) for the i-th tutorial class.
