Since the kingdom has M radar stations but only K operators, we can at most operate K radars. All radars have the same circular coverage with a radius of R. Our goal is to minimize R while covering the entire city with no more than K radars.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases.
