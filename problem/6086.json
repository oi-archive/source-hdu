Yuta is worrying about this situation, so he gives Rikka some math tasks to practice. There is one of them:<br><br>Yuta has $n$ $01$ strings $s_i$, and he wants to know the number of $01$ antisymmetric strings of length $2L$ which contain all given strings $s_i$ as continuous substrings.<br><br>A $01$ string $s$ is antisymmetric if and only if $s[i] \\neq s[|s|-i+1]$ for all $i \\in [1,|s|]$.<br><br>It is too difficult for Rikka. Can you help her?<br><br>In the second sample, the strings which satisfy all the restrictions are $000111,001011,011001,100110$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a number $t(1 \\leq t \\leq 5)$, the number of the testcases. <br><br>For each testcase, the first line contains two numbers $n,L(1 \\leq n \\leq 6, 1 \\leq L \\leq 100)$. <br><br>Then $n$ lines follow, each line contains a $01$ string $s_i(1 \\leq |s_i| \\leq 20)$.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each testcase, print a single line with a single number -- the answer modulo 998244353.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n2 2\n011\n001\n2 3\n011\n001</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2017+Multi-University+Training+Contest+-+Team+5&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2017 Multi-University Training Contest - Team 5 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
