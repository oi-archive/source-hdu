Your task is to clear all of them with your super laser gun at the fixed position (x, y).<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;For each laser shot, your laser beam can reflect 1 times (must be 1 times), which means it can kill 2 enemies at one time. And the energy this shot costs is the total length of the laser path.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;For example, if you are at (0, 0), and use one laser shot kills the 2 enemies in the order of (3, 4), (6, 0), then the energy this shot costs is 5.0 + 5.0 = 10. 00.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Since there are 2 * n enemies, you have to shot n times to clear all of them. For each shot, it is you that select two existed enemies and decide the reflect order.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Now, telling you your position and the 2n enemies&#x2019; position, to save the energy, can you tell me how much energy you need at least to clear all of them?<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Note that:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;    &gt; Each enemy can only be attacked once.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;    &gt; All the positions will be unique.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;    &gt; You must attack 2 different enemies in one shot.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;    &gt; You can&#x2019;t change your position.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single positive integer T( T &lt;= 100 ), indicates the number of test cases.<br>For each case:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;There are 2 integers x and y in the first line, which means your position.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;The second line is an integer n(1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10), denote there are 2n enemies.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Then there following 2n lines, each line have 2 integers denote the position of an enemy.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;All the position integers are between -1000 and 1000.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case: output the case number as shown and then print a decimal v, which is the energy you need at least to clear all of them (round to 2 decimal places).","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n\n0 0\n1\n6 0\n3 0\n\n0 0\n2\n1 0\n2 1\n-1 0\n-2 0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 6.00\nCase #2: 4.41</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2011+Multi-University+Training+Contest+9+-+Host+by+BJTU&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2011 Multi-University Training Contest 9 - Host by BJTU </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
