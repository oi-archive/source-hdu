For every pair of friends, they can choose to become online friends (communicating using online applications) or offline friends (mostly using face-to-face communication). However, everyone in these $n$ people wants to have the same number of online and offline friends (i.e. If one person has $x$ onine friends, he or she must have $x$ offline friends too, but different people can have different number of online or offline friends). Please determine how many ways there are to satisfy their requirements. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input is a single integer $T\\ (T=100)$, indicating the number of testcases. <br><br>For each testcase, the first line contains two integers $n\\ (1 \\le  n \\le 8)$ and $m\\ (0 \\le m \\le \\frac{n(n-1)}{2})$, indicating the number of people and the number of pairs of friends, respectively. Each of the next $m$ lines contains two numbers $x$ and $y$, which mean $x$ and $y$ are friends.
