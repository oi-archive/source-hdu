Bob has some positive integer sequences with different size. Alice wants to know the total occurrences of every sequence Bob has in Alice&apos;s sequence (the occurrences are allowed to overlap).<br><br>We say one sequence $B$ occurs in another sequence $A$ if there is a contiguous subsequence of $A$ that is the same as $B$ after scaled by a positive real factor.<br><br>For example $A=\\{2,4,8,16\\}, B = \\{1, 2\\}$ then $B$ occurs three times in $A$. The occurrences are $\\{2, 4\\}$, $\\{4,8\\}$ and $\\{8, 16\\}$. And the factor is 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
