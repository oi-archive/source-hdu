Now you want to transport K units of goods from city 1 to city N. There are many robbers on the road, so you must be very careful. The more goods you carry, the more dangerous it is. To be more specific, for each road i, there is a coefficient a<sub>i</sub>. If you want to carry x units of goods along this road, you should pay a<sub>i</sub> * x<sup>2</sup> dollars to hire guards to protect your goods. And what&#x2019;s worse, for each road i, there is an upper bound C<sub>i</sub>, which means that you cannot transport more than C<sub>i</sub> units of goods along this road. Please note you can only carry integral unit of goods along each road.<br>You should find out the minimum cost to transport all the goods safely. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases.
