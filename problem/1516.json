Here we give the definition. A transform list is a list of string, where each string, except for the last one, can be changed to the string followed by adding a character, deleting a character or replacing a character. The length of a transform list is the count of strings minus 1 (that is the count of operations to transform these two strings). The distance between two strings is the length of a transform list from one string to the other with the minimal length. You are to write a program to calculate the distance between two strings and give the corresponding transform list.
