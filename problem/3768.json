Each test case begins with a line containing two integers N and M, the number of intersections and roads in the city, respectively. Each of these integers is between 1 and 100000, inclusive. The intersections are numbered from 0 to N-1. Your house is at the intersection numbered 0. M lines follow, each containing three integers X, Y, and D, indicating that the intersections X and Y are connected by a bidirectional road of length D. The following line contains a single integer S, the number of stores you need to visit, which is between 1 and ten, inclusive.
