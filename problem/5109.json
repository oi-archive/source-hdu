He is new to programming. One day he is solving the following problem: Given two positive integers A and B, output A*B.<br>This problem is even easier than the last one. Alexandra can&apos;t wait to give him another task: Given a positive integer A and a string S(S only contains numbers.), find the minimum positive integer B, such that S is a substring of T, where T is the decimal notation of A*B.<br>See the sample for better understanding.<br>Note: S can contain leading zeros, but T can&apos;t.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases (no more than 500).
