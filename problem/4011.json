He finds an intern position in Beijing, so that he cannot attend all the college activities. But in some conditions, he must come back to Shanghai on certain date. We can assume the important activities that Mr. M must attend are occupy a whole day. Mr. M must take flight to Shanghai before that day and leave after that day. On the other hand, Mr. M is absent in Beijing and he will lose his salary for his absent.<br>Sometimes the cost of flight is much higher than the loss of salary, so to save the cost on the travel, Mr. M can stay in Shanghai to wait for another important date before he back to Beijing.<br>Now, Mr. M knows all of the important date in the next year. Help him schedule his travel to optimize the cost.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases.
