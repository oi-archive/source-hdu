Their sides are all vertical or horizontal. Each rectangle can be partially or totally covered by the others. The length of the boundary of the union of all rectangles is called the perimeter. <br><br>Write a program to calculate the perimeter. An example with 7 rectangles is shown in Figure 1. <br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/1828-1.jpg\"></center><br><br>The corresponding boundary is the whole set of line segments drawn in Figure 2. <br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/1828-2.jpg\"></center><br><br>The vertices of all rectangles have integer coordinates.

In each of the subsequent lines, one can find the integer coordinates of the lower left vertex and the upper right vertex of each rectangle. The values of those coordinates are given as ordered pairs consisting of an x-coordinate followed by a y-coordinate. <br><br>0 &lt;= number of rectangles &lt; 5000 <br>All coordinates are in the range [-10000,10000] and any existing rectangle has a positive area.<br><br>Please process to the end of file.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Your program is to write to standard output.
