So that a chain of &quot;a friend of a friend&quot; can be made to connect any 2 persons and it contains no more than 7 persons.<br>For example, if XXX is YYY&#x2019;s friend and YYY is ZZZ&#x2019;s friend, but XXX is not ZZZ&apos;s friend, then there is a friend chain of length 2 between XXX and ZZZ. The length of a friend chain is one less than the number of persons in the chain.<br>Note that if XXX is YYY&#x2019;s friend, then YYY is XXX&#x2019;s friend. Give the group of people and the friend relationship between them. You want to know the minimum value k, which for any two persons in the group, there is a friend chain connecting them and the chain&apos;s length is no more than k .<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple cases. <br>For each case, there is an integer N (2&lt;= N &lt;= 1000) which represents the number of people in the group. <br>Each of the next N lines contains a string which represents the name of one people.
