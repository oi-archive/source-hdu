Every time, you can do one of the following three operations:<br><br>1. Change all the $x$ in A into $y$. This operation costs $Cost0$.<br>2. Change all the $y$ in A into $z$. This operation costs $Cost1$.<br>3. Change all the $z$ in A into $x$. This operation costs $Cost2$.<br><br>One extra restriction is that when you operate any of these operations, the string $A$ needs to be changed. More specifically, when you operate the first operation, there should be at least one $x$ in string $A$, etc. Please calculate how many different ways there are to change the string $A$ into string $B$, while using not more than $macCost$ total cost. The answer could be very large, so please print the actual answer module $10^9+7$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input is a single integer $T\\ (T \\le 1000)$, indicating the number of testcases. <br><br>For each of the testcases, the first line contains four integers $Cost0, Cost1, Cost2, maxCost(1 \\le Cost0, Cost1, Cost2 \\le 1e18, 0 \\le maxCost \\le 1e18)$.
