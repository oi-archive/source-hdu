Given a general set of points X in 3-dimensional space, the convex hull of X is the smallest convex shape containing all the points.<br>For example, consider X = {(0, 0, 0), (10, 0, 0), (0, 10, 0), (0, 0, 10)}. The convex hull of X is the tetrahedron with vertices given by X.<br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/2684-1.jpg\"> <br>Given X, your task is to find the girth of the convex hull of X, rounded to the nearest integer.<br><br>You may assume there will be at most 3 points in X on any face of the convex hull.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input test file will contain multiple test cases, each of which begins with an integer n (4 &#x2264; n &#x2264; 25) indicating the number of points in X.
