Moreover, it is common that if the answer is $\\frac{a}{b}$, you should output $a \\times b^{-1} \\pmod{p}$ ($p$ is a prime number). In these problems, you cannot know the exact value of the probability. It&apos;s so confusing!!! Now, we want to reverse engineer the exact probability from such calculated output value $x$. We do so by guessing the probability is the one with the minimum $b$ such that $a \\times b^{-1} = x \\pmod{p}$. Now we invite you to solve this problem with us!<br><br>You are given two positive integers $p$ and $x$, where $p$ is a prime number.<br><br>Please find the smallest positive integer $b$ such that there exist some positive integer $a$ satisfying $a &lt; b$ and $a \\equiv bx \\pmod{p}$.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer $T$ indicating there are $T$ tests.
