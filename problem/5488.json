And only with translation, we can use these units to cover the whole plane without any gap. However, it is hard to find a new pentagon and its corresponding repeat unit. That&#x2019;s why the $15^{th}$ pentagon shape was found with the help of computer. We can see how complex it is that it almost cannot be worked out manually.<br>In this problem, you are going to do a much easier task. You have to write a program to judge whether a given polygon can cover a plane just by translation. You don&#x2019;t have to handle rotation, symmetry and any other operations, just translation. And you only need to give out your judgment.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a number $T$ indicating the number of test cases ($T&#x2264;50$).<br>For each test, the first line contains an integer $N$, which indicates the number of the nodes ($3&#x2264;N&#x2264;20$). And the following $N$ lines give the coordinates $Xi$ and $Yi$ of each node $i$. All the coordinates are integer and the absolute value of each coordinate will not exceed 20.
