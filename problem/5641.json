He becomes interested in the pattern lock screen.<br><br>The pattern interface is a $3 \\times 3$ square lattice, the three points in the first line are labeled as $1, 2, 3$, the three points in the second line are labeled as $4, 5, 6$, and the three points in the last line are labeled as $7, 8, 9$&#x3002;The password itself is a sequence, representing the points in chronological sequence, but you should follow the following rules:<br><br>- The password contains at least four points.<br><br><br>- Once a point has been passed through. It can&apos;t be passed through again.<br>  <br>- The middle point on the path can&apos;t be skipped, unless it has been passed through($3427$ is valid, but $3724$ is invalid).<br>  <br>  His password has a length for a positive integer $k (1\\le k\\le 9)$, the password sequence is $s_1,s_2...s_k(0\\le s_{i} &lt; INT\\_MAX)$ , he wants to know whether the password is valid.
