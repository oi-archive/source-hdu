After several weeks of research, He recognize that there are some magic words in the world, if a word contains a magic word as its substring, it will have magic power. For example, if the word &apos;magic&apos; is magic word, then the word &apos;magic&apos;, &apos;amagic&apos;, &apos;xxmagic&apos;, &apos;magiczz&apos; are all power words. <br><br>In addition to this finding, he also find that the index of a powerword has a important impact on the power of word. The index of a power word define as follow: given the set of magic words, if we list all the powerword contain one or more magic word as substring in a list lexicographically from short length to long, the curring position of a word in the list is its index. So, if the magic words are &apos;magic&apos; and &apos;hello&apos;, then word have index 1 is &apos;hello&apos;, the word have index 2 is &apos;magic&apos;, the word have index 3 is &apos;ahello&apos; ... (only consider the lowercase words) .<br><br>Now, loneknight have find a way to calculate the the indices of the most powerful words, he want to find what the actually word is. Can you help him?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases.
