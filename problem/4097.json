She is such a smart girl that she soon realizes two triangles can form a quadrangle without overlapping each other. She picks up a lot of triangles and uses them to form some quadrangles. Unfortunately, she is not good at this kind of jigsaw game and makes some mistakes.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;As her brother, you are curious about whether she has made a mistake when forming two triangles into a quadrangle. You are thinking about to write a program to determine it.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Notice that the quadrangle in this problem is defined as a simple polygon with four vertexes. And you may also assume that all triangles and quadrangle have positive area.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Note that two graphs are considered as the same if and only if they can overlap completely by shifting, rotation and flipping. You can also shifting, rotation and flipping one of the triangles to form the triangles to a quadrangle.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"&#xA0;&#xA0;There are multiple test cases.
