Please tell me the maximum number of the edges you can add that the graph is still a simple directed graph. Also, after you add these edges, this graph must NOT be strongly connected.<br><strong>A simple directed graph is a directed graph having no multiple edges or graph loops.<br>A strongly connected digraph is a directed graph in which it is possible to reach any node starting from any other node by traversing edges in the direction(s) in which they point. <br></strong>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of date is an integer T, which is the number of the text cases.<br>Then T cases follow, each case starts of two numbers N and M, 1&lt;=N&lt;=100000, 1&lt;=M&lt;=100000, representing the number of nodes and the number of edges, then M lines follow.
