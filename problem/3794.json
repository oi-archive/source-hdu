Each coupon has an integer N printed on it, meaning that when you use this coupon with a product, you may get N times the value of that product back! What is more, the shop also offers some bonus product for free. However, if you apply a coupon with a positive N to this bonus product, you will have to pay the shop N times the value of the bonus product... but hey, magically, they have some coupons with negative N&apos;s!<br>For example, given a set of coupons {1 2 4 -1}, and a set of product values {7 6 -2 -3} (in Mars dollars M$) where a negative value corresponds to a bonus product. You can apply coupon 3 (with N being 4) to product 1 (with value M$7) to get M$28 back; coupon 2 to product 2 to get M$12 back; and coupon 4 to product 4 to get M$3 back. On the other hand, if you apply coupon 3 to product 4, you will have to pay M$12 to the shop.<br>Each coupon and each product may be selected at most once. Your task is to get as much money back as possible.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Your program must read test cases from standard input.<br>The input file consists of several test cases.
