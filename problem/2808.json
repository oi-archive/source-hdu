Some islands are enclosed by other ones. So, we can classify all the islands to several levels. An island has a level of 0 if it is contains no other islands. An island has a level of K+1 if it contains one or more islands and the highest level of the contained island(s) is K. Now, the map of the sea is given. Your task is to calculate the areas of islands in each level.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases. Each test case starts with a line contains two numbers N and M(1&lt;=N&lt;=100,1&lt;=M&lt;=100) which indicate the size of the map. The next N lines will contain M characters each to represent the map. Each character is either &apos;x&apos; or &apos;.&apos;. A sea is defined as a maximal connected group of &apos;.&apos; cells, where two &apos;.&apos; cells are connected if they are vertically or horizontally adjacent. An island is defined as a maximal connected group of &apos;x&apos; cells, where two &apos;x&apos; cells are connected if they are vertically, horizontally, or diagonally adjacent. An island A contains island B if A and B are different and if you start sailing from any point of island B, you won&apos;t be able to sail out of island A.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output a single line with K+1 integers, where K is the highest level of an island in the map. The i-th number in the line is the total area of islands of level (i-1).","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1 1\nx\n5 7\n.xxxxx.\nx.....x\nx.x.x.x\nx.....x\n.xxxxx.</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n2 16</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=HDU+2009-4+Programming+Contest&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> HDU 2009-4 Programming Contest </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
