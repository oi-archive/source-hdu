And the time on the train is very boring, so Xiao Ming will use the mobile Internet. We all know that mobile phone receives the signal from base station and it will change the base station when moving on the train. Xiao Ming would like to know how many times the base station will change from city A to city B.<br>Now, the problem is simplified. We assume the route of train is straight, and the mobile phone will receive the signal from the nearest base station. <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Multiple cases.
