Two positions (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), where 1 &#x2264; x1,y1,x2,y2 &#x2264; n, are called &quot;independent&quot; if they occupy different rows and different columns, that is, x1&#x2260;x2 and y1&#x2260;y2. More generally, n positions are called independent if they are pairwise independent. It follows that there are n! different ways to choose n independent positions. <br><br>Assume further that a number is written in each position of such an n&#xD7;n square. This square is called &quot;homogeneous&quot; if the sum of the numbers written in n independent positions is the same, no matter how the positions are chosen. Write a program to determine if a given square is homogeneous! <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases. <br>The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 &#x2264; n &#x2264; 1000).
