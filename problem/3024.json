Suppose that we have a graph with n nodes, in each one there is a machine that has to be repaired, and there is only one repairman. We are given the time required by the repairman to travel among nodes. The objective is to find a tour that minimizes the total waiting time of all the machines. (ignore time of repairing)<br><br>Now for simplicity, we place all nodes on a straight line. Your task is to find out smallest sum of waiting time of all the machines.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a single integer T, which is the number of test case. Each case starts with a line containing a single integer N (1 &#x2264; N &#x2264; 400), the number of nodes. The next line gives a list of N corrdinate of nodes. Each corrdinate is a integer in the range [-1000, 1000]. Consecutive integers are separated by a single space charcter. The repairman will depart from origin. Suppose he travels at unit speed.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each case, output one line with the smallest sum of waiting time.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n2\n-1 2\n3\n-1 1 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5\n8</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2009+Multi-University+Training+Contest+6+-+Host+by+WHU&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2009 Multi-University Training Contest 6 - Host by WHU </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
