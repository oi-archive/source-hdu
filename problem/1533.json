In each unit time, every little man can move one unit step, either horizontally, or vertically, to an adjacent point. For each little man, you need to pay a $1 travel fee for every step he moves, until he enters a house. The task is complicated with the restriction that each house can accommodate only one little man. <br><br>Your task is to compute the minimum amount of money you need to pay in order to send these n little men into those n different houses. The input is a map of the scenario, a &apos;.&apos; means an empty space, an &apos;H&apos; represents a house on that point, and am &apos;m&apos; indicates there is a little man on that point. <br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"./data/images/1533.jpg\"><br>You can think of each point on the grid map as a quite large square, so it can hold n little men at the same time; also, it is okay if a little man steps on a grid with a house without entering that house.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are one or more test cases in the input.
