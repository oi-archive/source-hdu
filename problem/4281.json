Suddenly, N - 1 (N &lt;= 16) contestants hand up their hand at the same time. The judges should go to answer the contestants&apos; question one by one. The judges already foresee that answering contest i&apos;s question would cost Ci minutes. In order to serve all the contestant, each judges is assigned to serve some subset of the contestants. As the judges have limited patience, each one of them can serve the contestants for no more than M minutes.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;You are asked to solve two problems:<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;1. At least how many judges should be sent so that they can serve all the contestants? (Because the judges have limited patience, each one of them cannot serve too many contestants.)<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;2. If there are infinite number of judges, how to assign the route for each judge so that the sum of their walking time is minimized? Each contestant i is reside in place (xi, yi), the judges are in place (x1, y1).
