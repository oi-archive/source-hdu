Each transportation company is responsible for transporting on one leg of the river. For the regulations  of the GBs, each company is only allowed to have the same type boats. <br><br>The sands of the river keep changing  the depth of the water. Boats will get stranded if the water depth is less than the waterline, so the GM often digs the riverbed to maintain watercourse to transport smoothly.<br><br>Mr April wants to send a gift to Ms April for her birthday via the canal. But he do not know whether the watercourse is smooth, he turns to intelligent you for help to tell him whether he can deliver the gift or not.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"In the first line ,there are 3 non-negative interger , S, H and X, S stands for the length of the river, H is the original depth of the water, and there are X transportation companies.<br><br>Then follow  X  lines, in  the (1+i)th line ,there are 3 numbers, a , b, and c, indicate Company i is responsible for the transportation between a and b, and c is the waterline of the boats from the company.<br><br>In (X+2)th line there is an interger Q , indicating there would be Q command lines.
