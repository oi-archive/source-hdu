Moreover, $\\Phi_n(x) = \\prod_{1 \\leq k \\leq n, \\gcd(n, k) = 1}{\\left(x - {w_n}^k\\right)}$, where $w_n = \\cos\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi}{n}\\right) + \\sqrt{-1} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi}{n}\\right)$ is the unit complex root of degree $n$ and $\\gcd(n, k)$ is the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $k$.<br>Although he found such a conclusion, he couldn&apos;t obtain the result of some high-degree polynomial in a few seconds. Could you please help him accomplish some factorizations of $(x^n - 1)$?<br>Here are some examples:<br> $\\Phi_1(x) = x - 1$;<br> $\\Phi_2(x) = x + 1$, $x^2 - 1 = (x - 1) (x + 1)$;<br> $\\Phi_3(x) = x^2 + x + 1$, $x^3 - 1 = (x - 1) (x^2 + x + 1)$;<br> $\\Phi_4(x) = x^2 + 1$, $x^4 - 1 = (x - 1) (x + 1) (x^2 + 1)$;<br> $\\Phi_6(x) = x^2 - x + 1$, $x^6 - 1 = (x - 1) (x + 1) (x^2 - x + 1) (x^2 + x + 1)$;<br> $\\Phi_{12}(x) = x^4 - x^2 + 1$, $x^{12} - 1 = (x - 1) (x + 1) (x^2 - x + 1) (x^2 + 1) (x^2 + x + 1) (x^4 - x^2 + 1)$.<br><br>Oops! You might have some observations such as the degree of $\\Phi_n(x)$ equals to $\\varphi(n)$, coefficients of $\\Phi_n(x)$ are the same back-to-front as front-to-back except for $\\Phi_1(x)$, $\\Phi_{p^e}(x) = \\Phi_{p}\\left(x^{p^{e - 1}}\\right)$ when $p$ is prime, etc. , but they might be worthless for solving.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains one integer $T$, indicating the number of test cases.<br>Each of the following $T$ lines describes a test case and contains only one integer $n$.<br>$1 \\leq T \\leq 100$, $2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$.<br>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ in all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^6$.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output the factorization as a string without any space in one line, where the polynomials should be sorted in a particular order and each polynomial should be printed in a particular format and enclosed in a pair of parentheses.<br><b>Order of polynomials:</b> The order of polynomial $f(x)$ is lower than that of polynomial $g(x)$ if and only if there exists a non-negative integer $m$ such that the coefficient of $x^k$ $(k = m + 1, m + 2, \\cdots)$ in $f(x)$ equals to that of $g(x)$ but the coefficient of $x^m$ in $f(x)$ is less than that of $g(x)$.<br><b>Output format of one polynomial:</b> Output all the terms of the polynomial from high-degree to low-degree, each of which should be formed as $\\pm c_{k} x^{k}$.
