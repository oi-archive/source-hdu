A number can have more than one ternary expansion. A ternary expansion is indicated with a subscript 3. For example, 1 = 1<sub>3</sub> = 0.222...<sub>3</sub>, and 0.875 = 0.212121...<sub>3</sub>.<br><br>The Cantor set is defined as the real numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive that have a ternary expansion that does not contain a 1. If a number has more than one ternary expansion, it is enough for a single one to not contain a 1.<br><br>For example, 0 = 0.000...<sub>3</sub> and 1 = 0.222...<sub>3</sub>, so they are in the Cantor set. But 0.875 = 0.212121...<sub>3</sub> and this is its only ternary expansion, so it is not in the Cantor set.<br><br>Your task is to determine whether a given number is in the Cantor set.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases. <br><br>Each test case consists of a single line containing a number <b><i>x</i></b> written in decimal notation, with 0 &lt;= <b><i>x</i></b> &lt;= 1, and having at most 6 digits after the decimal point. <br><br>The last line of input is END.
