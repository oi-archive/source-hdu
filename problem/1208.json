The goal is to travel along any legitimate path from the upper left corner to the lower right corner of the board. The integer in any one square dictates how large a step away from that location must be. If the step size would advance travel off the game board, then a step in that particular direction is forbidden. All steps must be either to the right or toward the bottom. Note that a 0 is a dead end which prevents any further progress. <br><br><br>Consider the 4 x 4 board shown in Figure 1, where the solid circle identifies the start position and the dashed circle identifies the target. Figure 2 shows the three paths from the start to the target, with the irrelevant numbers in each removed. <br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1208-1.jpg\"> </center><br><center>Figure 1 </center><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1208-2.jpg\"></center><br><center> Figure 2</center>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains data for one to thirty boards, followed by a final line containing only the integer -1.
