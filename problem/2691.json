The 3-dimensional cubes are so difficult that Alex can only challenge the 2D ones, which have  <br>six colors: W, Y, R, O, G, B. <br> <img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/2691.jpg\"><br>Alex names the six faces as U(upper), D(bottom), L(left), R(right), F(front), B(back). The expanded cube will appear like  <br>this: <br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/2691.2.jpg\"><br>Alex is able to rotate any face 90 degrees in clockwise or counter-clockwise in a second. U, D, L, R, F, B are used for rotating the  <br>corresponding face in clockwise, while U&apos;, D&apos;, L&apos;, R&apos;, F&apos;, B&apos; are for counter-clockwise. <br><br>Now Alex got a Cube, he wants to know the minimum number of steps required for making one state to the other.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of multiple test cases.
