You begin at P1 and visit all points then back to P1. But there is a constraint: <br>Before you reach the rightmost point Pn, you can only visit the points those have the bigger x-coordinate value. For example, you are at Pi now, then you can only visit Pj(j &gt; i). When you reach Pn, the rule is changed, from now on you can only visit the points those have the smaller x-coordinate value than the point you are in now, for example, you are at Pi now, then you can only visit Pj(j &lt; i). And in the end you back to P1 and the tour is over.<br>You should visit all points in this tour and you can visit every point only once.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of multiple test cases.
