There are $n$ sections on the road, the $i$-th section has a non-negative integer length $s_i$. JRY will choose some continuous sections to race (at an unbelievable speed), so there are totally $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ different ways for him to ride. If JRY rides across from the $i$-th section to the $j$-th section, he would gain $j-i+1$ pleasure. Now JRY wants to know, if he tries all the ways whose length is $s$, what&apos;s the total pleasure he can get. Please be aware that in the problem, the length of one section could be zero, which means that the length is so trivial that we can regard it as $0$.
