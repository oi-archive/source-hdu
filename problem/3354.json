Teachers encourage pupils to play the game as it enhances their arithmetic skills, logical thinking, and following-up simple procedures. We think that, most probably, you too will master in few minutes. Here&#x2019;s one example of how you too can play this game: Ask a friend to think of a number, let&#x2019;s call it n<sub>0</sub>.<br>Then:<br>1. Ask your friend to compute n<sub>1</sub> = 3 * n<sub>0</sub> and to tell you if n1 is even or odd.<br>2. If n<sub>1</sub> is even, ask your friend to compute n<sub>2</sub> = n<sub>1</sub>/2. If, otherwise, n<sub>1</sub> was odd then let your friend compute n<sub>2</sub> = (n<sub>1</sub> + 1)/2.<br>3. Now ask your friend to calculate n<sub>3</sub> = 3 * n<sub>2</sub>.<br>4. Ask your friend to tell tell you the result of n<sub>4</sub> = n<sub>3</sub>/9. (n<sub>4</sub> is the quotient of the division operation. In computer lingo, &#x2019;/&#x2019; is the integer-division operator.)<br>5. Now you can simply reveal the original number by calculating n<sub>0</sub> = 2 * n<sub>4</sub> if n<sub>1</sub> was even, or n<sub>0</sub> = 2 * n<sub>4</sub> + 1 otherwise.<br>Here&#x2019;s an example that you can follow: If n<sub>0</sub> = 37, then n<sub>1</sub> = 111 which is odd. Now we can calculate n<sub>2</sub> = 56, n<sub>3</sub>= 168, and n<sub>4</sub> = 18, which is what your friend will tell you. Doing the calculation 2 &#xD7; n<sub>4</sub> + 1 = 37 reveals n<sub>0</sub>.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Your program will be tested on one or more test cases.
