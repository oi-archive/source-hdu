The rain is collected in a vertical transparent tube with millimeter markings, and once the rain has stopped falling, one can check the height of the water in the tube.<br><br>In our problem, the tube unfortunately has a leak at height <i>L</i> millimeters (mm). If the water level is above the leak then water drains from the tube at a rate of <i>K</i> millimeters per hour (mm/h).<br><br>We want to figure out how much rain fell during a particular rainfall. <i>We assume that the tube is high enough that it does not overflow. We also assume that rain falls at an (unknown) uniform rate during a rainfall, and that water does not evaporate from the tube. The height of the leak itself is also negligible.</i><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input is a line with five positive numbers: <i>L K T1 T2 H</i> where<br><br><i>L</i> is where the leak is (mm)<br><br><i>K</i> is the rate at which water leaks (mm/h)<br><br><i>T1</i> is the duration of the rainfall (h)<br><br><i>T2</i> is the time between the end of the rainfall and the observation of the water level (h)<br><br><i>H</i> is the water level in the tube when we observe it (mm)<br><br>Each number is at least 0.01 and at most 1000.00, and each is given with two decimals.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"One line with two floating point numbers <i>F1 F2</i> where <i>F1</i> is the smallest rainfall in millimeters that would result in the given observation, and <i>F2</i> is the largest rainfall in millimeters that would result in the given observation.
