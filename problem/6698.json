Now you want to pick exactly $k$ coins out of them.

In other words, in the $i$-th group, you can<br>- pick none of the two coins;<br>- pick only the first one valued at $a_i$; or<br>- pick both of them. <br><br>We now want to know the maximum sum of the $k$ picked coins&apos; values, denoted by $f(k)$. <br><br>Furthermore, we want to know $f(1), f(2), \\cdots, f(2n)$.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases, and the first line contains a single integer $T~(1 \\le T \\le 90)$, the number of test cases.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains an integer $n~(1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000)$, indicating the number of coin groups.<br><br>Each of the following $n$ lines contains two integers $a_i,b_i~(1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le 10\\,000)$ indicating the coin values in that group.<br><br>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ in all test cases does not exceed $2\\,100\\,000$.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test group, just output $2n$ integers in a single line representing $f(1), f(2), \\cdots, f(2n)$, and adjacent integers should be separated by one space.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n3\n1 2\n1 4\n4 2\n2\n1 3\n3 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4 6 9 11 12 14\n3 5 7 9</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2019+Multi-University+Training+Contest+10&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2019 Multi-University Training Contest 10 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
