She wants to build a chicken pen so that each chicken has its own, unobstructed view of the countryside.  The pen will have three straight sides; this will give each chicken its own side so it can pace back and forth without interfering with the other chickens.    Xiaoyan finds a roll of chicken wire (fencing) in the barn that is exactly N feet long. She wants to figure out how many different ways she can make a three sided chicken pen such that each side is an integral number of feet, and she uses the entire roll of fence.<br>Different rotations of the same pen are the same, however, reflections of a pen may be different  (see below).<br><center><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C426-1003-1.jpg\"><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C426-1003-2.jpg\"> </center>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains a single integer P,(1&lt;=  P &lt;=1000), which is the number of data sets that follow.
