Lots of people like to play football. After one season of matches, the header has to calculate the last scores of every team. He is too lazy that he doesn&apos;t want to calculate, so he asks you to write a program for him to solve the problem.<br><br>Here are the rules:<br>1 Every team has to match with all the other teams.<br>2 Every two teams have to match for two times,one at home and one away.<br>3 In one match, the winner will get 3 points, the loser will get 0 point. If it is draw, both of them will get 1 point.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of many test cases.

One line a team, the format is: &quot;TeamX scores&quot;. If two teams get the same score, the one with high net goals will be ahead, which net goal means the difference between the total balls that the team kicked in and the total balls that the team lost. IE: if one team kicked in 30 balls and lost 40 balls, then the net goal is 30 &#x2013; 40 = -10. If two teams have the same score and the same net goal, the one whose kicked in balls is bigger will be ahead. If two teams have the same score and the same net goal and the same kicked in balls, they will be outputed in alphabetic order.<br><br>Output a blank line after each test case.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\nManchester VS Portsmouth 3:0\nLiverpool VS Manchester 1:1\nLiverpool VS Portsmouth 0:0\nPortsmouth VS Manchester 1:1\nManchester VS Liverpool 2:1\nLiverpool VS Portsmouth 1:2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Manchester 8\nPortsmouth 5\nLiverpool 2\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>Hint</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i>\nHuge input, scanf is recommended.</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"Gao Bo","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=%BA%BC%D6%DD%B5%E7%D7%D3%BF%C6%BC%BC%B4%F3%D1%A7%B5%DA%C8%FD%BD%EC%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%B4%F3%C8%FC&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> &#x676D;&#x5DDE;&#x7535;&#x5B50;&#x79D1;&#x6280;&#x5927;&#x5B66;&#x7B2C;&#x4E09;&#x5C4A;&#x7A0B;&#x5E8F;&#x8BBE;&#x8BA1;&#x5927;&#x8D5B; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
