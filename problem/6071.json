According to the rule, you must keep your speed, and your running distance should not be less than $K$ meters.<br><br>There are $4$ checkpoints in the campus, indexed as $p_1,p_2,p_3$ and $p_4$. Every time you pass a checkpoint, you should swipe your card, then the distance between this checkpoint and the last checkpoint you passed will be added to your total distance.<br><br>The system regards these $4$ checkpoints as a circle. When you are at checkpoint $p_i$, you can just run to $p_{i-1}$ or $p_{i+1}$($p_1$ is also next to $p_4$). You can run more distance between two adjacent checkpoints, but only the distance saved at the system will be counted.<br><br><center><br><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C762-1005-1.jpg\"><br></center> <br><br>Checkpoint $p_2$ is the nearest to the dormitory, Little Q always starts and ends running at this checkpoint.
