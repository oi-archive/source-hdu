But note that you cannot take two different exams at the same time. For example, it is impossible to take the first exam at $[3,5]$ and take the second exam at $[5,8]$. \\textbf{And note that for one exam}, the two periods of time may intersect, that is, $[a,\\ a+at] \\cap [b,\\ b+bt] \\ne \\emptyset$ is also possible. Now, you want to pass all the $n$ exams as soon as possible. Print the earlist time when the last exam was finished if you can pass all the $n$ exams or print $-1$ if you can not pass all the exams.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
