Divided into two groups, they were playing games together, forming a column. The $i-th$ GT would randomly get a value of ability $b_i$. At the $i-th$ second, the $i-th$ GT would annihilate GTs who are in front of him, whose group differs from his, and whose value of ability is less than his.<br><br>In order to make the game more interesting, GTW, the leader of those GTs, would emit energy for $m$ times, of which the $i-th$ time of emitting energy is $c_i$. After the $c_i$ second, $b_1, b_2,...,b_{c_i}$ would all be added 1.<br><br>GTW wanted to know how many GTs would survive after the $n-th$ second.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input file contains an integer $T (\\leq 5)$, which indicates the number of test cases.<br><br>For each test case, there are $n + m + 1$ lines in the input file.<br><br>The first line of each test case contains 2 integers $n$ and $m$, which indicate the number of GTs and the number of emitting energy, respectively.$(1\\leq n,m \\leq 50000)$<br><br>In the following $n$ lines, the $i-th$ line contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$, which indicate the group of the $i-th$ GT and his value of ability, respectively. $(0\\leq a_i\\leq 1, 1\\leq b_i\\leq 10^6)$<br><br>In the following $m$ lines, the $i-th$ line contains an integer $c_i$, which indicates the time of emitting energy for $i-th$ time.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"There should be exactly $T$ lines in the output file.<br><br>The $i-th$ line should contain exactly an integer, which indicates the number of GTs who survive.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n4 3\n0 3\n1 2\n0 3\n1 1\n1\n3\n4</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>After the first seconds,$b_1=4,b_2=2,b_3=3,b_4=1$\nAfter the second seconds,$b_1=4,b_2=2,b_3=3,b_4=1$\nAfter the third seconds,$b_1=5,b_2=3,b_3=4,b_4=1$,and the second GT is annihilated by the third one.\nAfter the fourth seconds,$b_1=6,b_2=4,b_3=5,b_4=2$\n$c_i$ is unordered.\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=BestCoder+Round+%2366+%28div.2%29&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> BestCoder Round #66 (div.2) </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
