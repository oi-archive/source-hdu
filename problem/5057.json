One day Argestes came up with such a problem. You are given a sequence a consisting of N nonnegative integers, a[1],a[2],...,a[n].Then there are M operation on the sequence.An operation can be one of the following:<br>S X Y: you should set the value of a[x] to y(in other words perform an assignment a[x]=y).<br>Q L R D P: among [L, R], L and R are the index of the sequence, how many numbers that the Dth digit of the numbers is P.<br>Note: The 1st digit of a number is the least significant digit.
