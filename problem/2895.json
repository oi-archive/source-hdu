There are<br>four kinds of instructions in an edit script:<br>Add (&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;a&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;): Output one character. This instruction does not consume any characters<br>from the source string.<br>Delete (&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;d&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;): Delete one character. That is, consume one character from the source string and output nothing.<br>Modify (&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;m&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;): Modify one character. That is, consume one character from the source string and output a character.<br>Copy (&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;c&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;): Copy one character. That is, consume one character from the source string and output the same character.<br>Now, We define that A shortest edit script is an edit script that minimizes the total number of adds and deletes.<br>Given two strings, generate a shortest edit script that changes the first into the second. <br><br><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of two strings on separate lines.
