There are<br>four kinds of instructions in an edit script:<br>Add (&#x2018;a&#x2019;): Output one character. This instruction does not consume any characters<br>from the source string.<br>Delete (&#x2018;d&#x2019;): Delete one character. That is, consume one character from the source string and output nothing.<br>Modify (&#x2018;m&#x2019;): Modify one character. That is, consume one character from the source string and output a character.<br>Copy (&#x2018;c&#x2019;): Copy one character. That is, consume one character from the source string and output the same character.<br>Now, We define that A shortest edit script is an edit script that minimizes the total number of adds and deletes.<br>Given two strings, generate a shortest edit script that changes the first into the second. <br><br><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of two strings on separate lines.
