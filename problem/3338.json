Apart from the top row and leftmost column which are entirely black, the grid has some amount of white cells which form &quot;runs&quot; and some amount of black cells. &quot;Run&quot; is a vertical or horizontal maximal one-lined block of adjacent white cells. Each row and column of the puzzle can contain more than one &quot;run&quot;. Every white cell belongs to exactly two runs &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; one horizontal and one vertical run. Each horizontal &quot;run&quot; always has a number in the black half-cell to its immediate left, and each vertical &quot;run&quot; always has a number in the black half-cell immediately above it. These numbers are located in &quot;black&quot; cells and are called &quot;clues&quot;.The rules of the puzzle are simple: <br><br>1.place a single digit from 1 to 9 in each &quot;white&quot; cell<br>2.for all runs, the sum of all digits in a &quot;run&quot; must match the clue associated with the &quot;run&quot;<br><br>Given the grid, your task is to find a solution for the puzzle.<br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/data/images/D5353-1001-1.png\"> &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/data/images/D5353-1001-2.png\"><br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Picture of the first sample input&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Picture of the first sample output","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains two integers n and m (2 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; n,m &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 100) &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; the number of rows and columns correspondingly.
