The snow-capped mountain range symbolises the Hermit&#x2019;s spiritual achievement, growth and accomplishment. He has chosen this path of self-discovery and, as a result, has reached a heighted state of awareness</i><br><br>dhh loves to listen to radio. There are $N$ radio stations on a number axis, and the i-th station is located at $x_i$ = $i$. The broadcasting scope of the $i$-th station is $rad_i$ , which means stations in the interval [$i$ - $rad_i$ + 1, $i$ + $rad_i$ - 1] can receive the signal from the $i$-th station. For some unknown reason, the left boundary that can receive the $i$-th station&#x2019;s signal is non-descending, which meansi $i$ - $rad_i$ + 1 &#x2264; $i$ + 1 - $rad_{i+1}$ + 1.<br>Now dhh wants to listen to the radio from station $i$, and he finds that the station $k$, satisfying both of the following conditions, can receive perfect signal from the station $i$:<br><br><li>k &lt; i and station k can receive station i&#x2019;s signal.</li><br><li>There exists another station $j$($k$ &#x2264; $j$ &lt; $i$) such that station $k$ and $i$ can both receive the signal from station $j$ and the distance between station $k$ and $j$ is greater than or equal to the distance between station $j$ and $i$.</li><br>Now dhh wonders for each station $i$, how many stations can receive the perfect signal from station $i$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains one integer $T$ &#x2264; 20, denoting the number of testcases.

The result in each position is 1 if only the first bit is 1 or only the second bit is 1, but will be 0 if both are 0 or both are 1. In this we perform the comparison<br>of two bits, being 1 if the two bits are different, and 0 if they are the same.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n7\n1 2 3 4 3 2 1\n10\n1 1 2 3 4 4 3 2 2 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case 1: 2\nCase 2: 0\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nIn the first testcase of the example, the number of stations that can receive the perfect signal from each station $i$ is respectively 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0 in order, so the answer must be \n\n<center>0 xor 0 xor 1 xor 2 xor 1 xor 0 xor 0 = 2</center>\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2018CCPC%BC%AA%C1%D6%C8%FC%C7%F8%A3%A8%D6%D8%CF%D6%C8%FC%A3%A9-+%B8%D0%D0%BB%B1%B1%BB%AA%B4%F3%D1%A7&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2018CCPC&#x5409;&#x6797;&#x8D5B;&#x533A;&#xFF08;&#x91CD;&#x73B0;&#x8D5B;&#xFF09;- &#x611F;&#x8C22;&#x5317;&#x534E;&#x5927;&#x5B66; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
