Every user in SNS has a friends list. The user can read news posted by the users in his friends list. Friend relation is symmetric - if A is a friend of B, B is always a friend of A.<br><br>Another important function in SNS is friend recommendation. One effective way to recommend friends is recommend by mutual friends. A mutual friend between two users A and B, is a user who is a friend of both A and B. A user can not be a friend of himself. For a specific user A, the system will recommend the user who is not himself or his friend, and has mutual friends with A. If more than one such user exists, recommend the one has most mutual friends with A. If still a tie exists, output all of them.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is a integer T (T&#x2264;100), the number of test case.<br>The beginning of each test case is two integers N and Q, the number of friend relationship and the number of query. 1 &#x2264; N, Q &#x2264; 1000<br>The following N lines each contain two different names separated by a single space.
