For years I&#x2019;ve been writing stories, some rather silly, just to make simple problems look difficult and complex problems look easy. But, alas, not for this one.<br>You&#x2019;re given a non empty string made in its entirety from opening and closing braces. Your task is to find the minimum number of &#x201C;operations&#x201D; needed to make the string stable. The definition for being stable is as follows:<br>1. An empty string is stable.<br>2. If S is stable, then {S} is also stable.<br>3. If S and T are both stable, then ST (the concatenation of the two) is also stable.<br>All of these strings are stable: {}, {}{}, and {{}{}}; But none of these: }{, {{}{, nor {}{.<br>The only operation allowed on the string is to replace an opening brace with a closing brace, or visa-versa.<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Your program will be tested on one or more data sets.
