To celebrate the fact, he intends to buy himself a spaceship and make an interstellar travel.<br>Little Q knows the position of $n$ planets in space, labeled by $1$ to $n$. To his surprise, these planets are all coplanar. So to simplify, Little Q put these $n$ planets on a plane coordinate system, and calculated the coordinate of each planet $(x_i,y_i)$.<br>Little Q plans to start his journey at the $1$-th planet, and end at the $n$-th planet. When he is at the $i$-th planet, he can next fly to the $j$-th planet only if $x_i&lt;x_j$, which will cost his spaceship $x_i\\times y_j-x_j\\times y_i$ units of energy. Note that this cost can be negative, it means the flight will supply his spaceship.<br>Please write a program to help Little Q find the best route with minimum total cost.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T(1\\leq T\\leq10)$, denoting the number of test cases.<br>In each test case, there is an integer $n(2\\leq n\\leq 200000)$ in the first line, denoting the number of planets.<br>For the next $n$ lines, each line contains $2$ integers $x_i,y_i(0\\leq x_i,y_i\\leq 10^9)$, denoting the coordinate of the $i$-th planet. Note that different planets may have the same coordinate because they are too close to each other.

Obviously $p_1$ should be $1$ and $p_m$ should be $n$. You should choose the route with minimum total cost. If there are multiple best routes, please choose the one with the smallest lexicographically.<br>A sequence of integers $a$ is lexicographically smaller than a sequence of $b$ if there exists such index $j$ that $a_i = b_i$ for all $i &lt; j$, but $a_j &lt; b_j$.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n3\n0 0\n3 0\n4 0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1 2 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2018+Multi-University+Training+Contest+3&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2018 Multi-University Training Contest 3 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
