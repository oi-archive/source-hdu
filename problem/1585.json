But because of his poor Emotional quotient, he will never write a perfect love-letter. There is no doubt that roses must come with a love-letter! However, fortunately, Gardon has invented a powerful tool: Auto Love-letter Maker(ALM).<br>Gardon had spent more than twenty years on ALM though he&apos;s only eighteen years old. It follows the principle of GNU General Public License, so we can discover the rules of his algorithm:<br>1, A love-letter will always be ended with &quot;Love you! yours Gardon&quot;. The word &quot;Gardon&quot; is not generated by algorithm.<br>2, A love-letter will always begin with &quot;Dear Angel&quot;.<br>3, The text of love-letter is generated by some rule called &quot;Markov Words Link&quot;. The next word is generated by the last two words.<br>For example, this ruls is:<br>dear angel ==&gt; i<br>angel i    ==&gt; miss love wanna<br>i miss     ==&gt; you<br>i love     ==&gt; you<br>i wanna    ==&gt; be<br>love you   ==&gt; for yours<br>miss you   ==&gt; i<br>you i      ==&gt; love<br>wanna be   ==&gt; with<br>be with    ==&gt; you<br>with you   ==&gt; for<br>you for    ==&gt; ever<br>for ever   ==&gt; i love<br>ever i     ==&gt; wanna<br>ever love  ==&gt; you<br>So we can get this short love-letter:<br><br>Dear Angel: <br>   I miss you!I love you for ever!I wanna be with you for ever!<br>   Love you!<br>                       Yours, Gardon.<br><br>But Gardon find that if he tried to use a rule template which is more complex, it is probable the letter will never stop! After checking the algorithm, he has learned the matter is brought by the Markov rule. So now, he need you help him to check all the words-link template.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input contains serveral words-links rules.each rule begin with a line &quot;**BEGIN**&quot; and end with a line &quot;** END **&quot;. each line will contain at least three ,at most thirty words: The first two words represent the rule case, and follow with all the valid words.<br>You can firmly assume that there will not be more than 10000 differents word in one case.
