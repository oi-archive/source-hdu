He has $m$ pieces of equipment, of which the $i$-th piece&apos;s volume is $b_i$ $(1 \\leq i \\leq n)$. Notice that volumes of different pieces may be the same.<br><br>Assuming that two plans are distinct if and only if they contain different pieces of equipment or there exists at least one integer $k$ $(1 \\leq k \\leq n)$ satisfying the number of the $k$-th food to store into the knapsack in this two plans are different, <b>KazaQ</b> is intend to know what is the total number of distinct plans for storing one piece of equipment and some food into the knapsack fully.
