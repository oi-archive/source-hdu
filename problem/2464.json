Given A and B, two undirected simple graphs with the same number of vertexes, you are to find a series of operations with the minimum cost that will make the two graphs equivalent. An operation may be one of the following two types:<br>a) Add an arbitrary edge (x, y), provided that (x, y) does not exist before such an operation. Such an operation costs I<sub>A</sub> and I<sub>B</sub> on two graphs, respectively.<br>b) Delete an existing edge (x, y), which costs D<sub>A</sub> and D<sub>B</sub> on two graphs,respectively.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases in the input file.<br>Each test case starts with three integers, N, M<sub>A</sub> and M<sub>B</sub>, ( 1 &#x2264; N &#x2264; 8, 0 &#x2264; M<sub>B</sub> ,M<sub>A</sub> &#x2264; N*(N-1)/2 ), the total number of vertexes, the number of edges in graph A,and the number of edges in graph B, respectively. Four integers I<sub>A</sub>, I<sub>B</sub>, D<sub>A</sub>, and D<sub>B</sub> come next, (0 &#x2264; I<sub>A</sub>, I<sub>B</sub>, D<sub>A</sub>,  D<sub>B</sub> &#x2264;  32767 ), representing the costs as stated in the problem description. The next M<sub>A</sub> + M<sub>B</sub> lines describe the edges in graph A followed by those in graph B. Each line consists of exactly two integers, X and Y ( X &#x2260; Y , 0 &#x2264; X,Y &lt; N).<br>Two successive test cases are separated by a blank line. A case with N = 0, M<sub>A</sub> = 0,and M<sub>B</sub> = 0 indicates the end of the input file, and should not be processed by your program.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"Please print the minimum cost in the format as illustrated below.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1 0 0\n1 2 3 7\n\n4 2 3\n1 6 5 1\n0 1\n0 3\n0 2\n1 2\n1 0\n\n0 0 0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 0\nCase #2: 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2008+Asia+Regional+Hangzhou&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2008 Asia Regional Hangzhou </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
