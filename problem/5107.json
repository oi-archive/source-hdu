Now you have observed n tall buildings in the city and recorded their position and height. Due to some mysterious reasons, you need to answer a series of queries. Each query will give you a position(x, y) and k, then you have to find out the k-th shortest building in set{$(x, y) | x \\leq X, y \\leq Y$}.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Multiple test cases.For each test case, the first line will contain two integers n and m($0 &lt; n \\leq 30000, 0 \\leq m \\leq 30000$), which represents the amount of buildings and amount of queries. Then n lines follow, contains three integers $x, y, h (-1E9 \\leq x, y \\leq 1E9, 0 \\leq h \\leq 1E9)$ indicate the building&apos;s position and height in each line.
