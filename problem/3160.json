Because you do not know how to play chess on such a large board, you find an alternative way to make use of it. <br><br>In chess, a rook attacks all squares that are in the same row or column of the chessboard as it is. For the purposes of this problem, we define a rook as also attacking the square on which it is already standing. <br><br>Given a set of chessboard squares, how many rooks are needed to attack all of them?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input consists of a number of test cases. Each test case consists of fifteen lines each containing fifteen characters depicting the chess board. Each character is either a period (.) or a hash (#).
