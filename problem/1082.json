Since matrix multiplication is associative, the order in which multiplications are performed is arbitrary. However, the number of elementary multiplications needed strongly depends on the evaluation order you choose.<br>For example, let A be a 50*10 matrix, B a 10*20 matrix and C a 20*5 matrix.<br>There are two different strategies to compute A*B*C, namely (A*B)*C and A*(B*C).<br>The first one takes 15000 elementary multiplications, but the second one only 3500. <br><br>Your job is to write a program that determines the number of elementary multiplications needed for a given evaluation strategy. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input consists of two parts: a list of matrices and a list of expressions.<br>The first line of the input file contains one integer n (1 &lt;= n &lt;= 26), representing the number of matrices in the first part.
