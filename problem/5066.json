However, learning magical knowledge alone is insufficient to become a great magician. Sometimes, Harry also has to gain knowledge from other certain subjects, such as language, mathematics, English, and even algorithm. <br>    Today, Harry&apos;s physical teacher set him a difficult problem: if a small ball moving with a speed $V_0$ made a completely elastic collision with a car moving towards the same direction with a speed $V (V&lt;V_0)$, and the car far outweighs the ball, what was the speed of the small ball after the collision?<br>This problem was so difficult that Harry hasn&apos;t figure out how to solve it. Therefore, he asks you for help. Could you do him this favor?
