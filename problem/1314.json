The mapping is very simple, with the ordering being done first by the length of the word, and then alphabetically. Part of the list is shown below. <br>   a          1<br>   b          2<br>   ...<br>   z          26<br>   aa         27<br>   ab         28<br>   ...<br>   snowfall   157,118,051,752<br>   ...<br><br>Your job in this problem is to develop a program which can translate, bidirectionally, between the unique word numbers and the corresponding words. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input to the program is a list of words and numbers, one per line starting in column one, followed by a line containing a single asterisk in column one. A number will consist only of decimal digits (0 through 9) followed immediately by the end of line (that is, there will be no commas in input numbers). A word will consist of between one and twenty lowercase alphabetic characters (a through z). <br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"The output is to contain a single line for each word or number in the input data.
