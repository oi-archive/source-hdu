Since 2991 = 1*1728 + 8*144 + 9*12 + 3, its duodecimal representation is 1893(12), and these digits also sum up to 21. But in hexadecimal 2991 is BAF16, and 11+10+15 = 36, so 2991 should be rejected by your program.<br><br>The next number (2992), however, has digits that sum to 22 in all three representations (including BB016), so 2992 should be on the listed output. (We don&apos;t want decimal numbers with fewer than four digits - excluding leading zeroes - so that 2992 is the first correct answer.)<br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There is no input for this problem.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"Your output is to be 2992 and all larger four-digit numbers that satisfy the requirements (in strictly increasing order), each on a separate line with no leading or trailing blanks, ending with a new-line character.
