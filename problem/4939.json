The goal of tower defense games is to try to stop enemies from crossing a map by building traps to slow them down and towers which shoot at them as they pass.<br><br>   The map is a line, which has n unit length. We can build only one tower on each unit length. The enemy takes t seconds on each unit length. And there are 3 kinds of tower in this game: The red tower, the green tower and the blue tower. <br><br>   The red tower damage on the enemy x points per second when he passes through the tower.<br><br>   The green tower damage on the enemy y points per second after he passes through the tower.<br><br>   The blue tower let the enemy go slower than before (that is, the enemy takes more z second to pass an unit length, also, after he passes through the tower.)<br>   <br>   Of course, if you are already pass through m green towers, you should have got m*y damage per second. The same, if you are already pass through k blue towers, the enemy should have took t + k*z seconds every unit length.<br><br>   FSF now wants to know the maximum damage the enemy can get.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"   There are multiply test cases.<br><br>   The first line contains an integer T (T&lt;=100), indicates the number of cases. <br><br>   Each test only contain 5 integers n, x, y, z, t (2&lt;=n&lt;=1500,0&lt;=x, y, z&lt;=60000,1&lt;=t&lt;=3)<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"   For each case, you should output &quot;Case #C: &quot; first, where C indicates the case number and counts from 1.
