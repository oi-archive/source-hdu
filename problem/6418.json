There is an interesting game in this movie.<br><br>The rule is like traditional Stone-Paper-Scissors. At the beginning of the game, each of the two players receives several cards, and there are three types of cards: scissors, stone, paper. And then in each round, two players need to play out a card simultaneously. The chosen cards will be discarded and can not be used in the remaining part of the game.<br><br>The result of each round follows the basic rule: Scissors beat Paper, Paper beats Stone, Stone beats Scissors. And the winner will get $1$ point, the loser will lose $1$ point, and the points will not change in the case of a draw. <br><br>Now, Rikka is playing this game with Yuta. At first, Yuta gets $a$ Scissors cards, $b$ Stone cards and $c$ Paper cards; Rikka gets $a&apos;$ Scissors cards, $b&apos;$ Stone cards, $c&apos;$ Paper cards. The parameters satisfy $a+b+c=a&apos;+b&apos;+c&apos;$. And then they will play the game exactly $a+b+c$ rounds (i.e., they will play out all the cards). <br><br>Yuta&apos;s strategy is &quot;random&quot;. Each round, he will choose a card among all remaining cards with equal probability and play it out. <br><br>Now Rikka has got the composition of Yuta&apos;s cards (i.e., she has got the parameters $a,b,c$) and Yuta&apos;s strategy (random).  She wants to calculate the maximum expected final points she can get, i.e., the expected final points she can get if she plays optimally.<br><br>Hint: Rikka can make decisions using the results of previous rounds and the types of cards Yuta has played.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single number $t(1\\leq t \\leq 10^4)$.<br><br>For each testcase, the first line contains three numbers $a,b,c$ and the second line contains three numbers $a&apos;,b&apos;,c&apos;(0 \\leq a,b,c,a&apos;,b&apos;,c&apos; \\leq 10^9, a+b+c =a&apos; + b&apos; + c&apos;&gt; 0)$.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each testcase, if the result is an integer, print it in a line directly. <br><br>Otherwise, if the result equals to $\\frac{a}{b}(|\\gcd(a,b)| = 1, b &gt; 0,$ $a$ and $b$ are integers$)$, output &quot;$a$/$b$&quot; (without the quote) in a single line.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n1 0 0\n0 0 1\n123 456 789\n100 200 1068</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n0\n-1\n3552/19</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2018+Multi-University+Training+Contest+9&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2018 Multi-University Training Contest 9 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
