I thought I&apos;d be seeing you soon,Harry Potter.&apos;It wasn&apos;t a question.You have your mother&apos;s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself,buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.&apos; <br>Mor Ollivander moved closer to Harry.Harry wished he would blink.Those sivery eyes were a bit creepy. <br>&apos;Your father, on the other hand, favoured a mahogany wand.Eleven inches.Pliable.A little more power and excellent for transfiguration.Well ,I say your father favoured it - it&apos;s really the wand that choosed the wizard, of cource.&apos; <br><br>Yes, some wands fit some wizards ,as we all know.But what Harry doesn&apos;t know is Ollivander have met a big trouble.That&apos;s more than twenty years ago,When Harry&apos;s father James Potter was still a student in Hogwarts.He went Diagon Alley to buy new books,passing by Ollivander&apos;s shop.Ollivander was crazy for a problem:He was too busy to choose most suitable wand for every wizard.Even more,there are too many customer that day.Though Ollivader knew every wand&apos;s favourite,he could not choose as many wizards as possible to get the wands. So James Potter,a very clever man ,gave him a magic disk with your program ,to help him sell wands as many as possible. <br><br>Please notice: one wand can only be sold to one wizard, and one wizard can only buy one wand,too. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several cases.
