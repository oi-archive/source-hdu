One of the most exciting events is the 10000M-running.During the match many students are running on the track. So, how about the rank list now?<br><br>As we know, in a running , we rank the player according to the length everyone has passed .  So if one player run 400M(one lap) farther than another player , it looks like they are running at the same position on the track , but the rank of the former is much better than the latter. Now given everyone&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s position on the track , and  one rank list , can you tell me whether the rank list is possible.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input gives the number of cases, T (at most 110). the first line of each case has two intergers, n,m.
