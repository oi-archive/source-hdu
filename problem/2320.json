So your task is to find the minimum number of borders that need to be crossed when traveling between two countries. We model the surface of Earth as a set of polygons in three dimensions forming a closed convex 3D shape, where each polygon corresponds to one country. You are not allowed to cross at points where more than two countries meet.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Each test case consists of a line containing c, the number of countries (4 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; c &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 6000), followed by c lines containing the integers n x1 y1 z1 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; xn yn zn, describing (in order) the n corners of a closed polygon (3 &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; n &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 20). Then follows a line with one integer m (0 &lt; m &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 50), and then m lines with queries ca cb, where ca and cb are country numbers (starting with 1). No point will be on the line between two connected points, and -10<sup>6</sup> &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; x, y, z &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; 10<sup>6</sup> for all points. No two non-adjacent edges of a country share a common point. The input is terminated by a case where c = 0, which should not be processed.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each query, output the number of borders you must cross to go from ca to cb.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">6\n4 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0\n4 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n4 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1\n4 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1\n4 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0\n4 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n2\n1 2\n1 3\n0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=Nordic+2006&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> Nordic 2006 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
