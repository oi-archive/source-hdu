The first integer always has at least two digits and starts with a non-zero digit. The second integer always has one digit less than the first integer and may start with a zero digit.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file consists of several test cases.<br><br>Each test case contains single integer N (10 &#x2264; N &#x2264; 10^9), as decribed above<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"The output consists of several blocks, one for each test case.<br><br>On the first line of a block write the total number of different pairs of integers that satisfy the problem statement.
