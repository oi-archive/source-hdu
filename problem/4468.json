However, the so-called &#x201C;secret message&#x201D; brought back by your spy, is in fact encrypted, forcing yourself into making deep study of message encryption employed by your enemy.<br>Finally you found how your enemy encrypts message. The original message, namely s, consists of lowercase Latin alphabets. Then the following steps would be taken:<br>* Step 1: Let r = s<br>* Step 2: Remove r&#x2019;s suffix (may be empty) whose length is less than length of s and append s to r. More precisely, firstly donate r[1...n], s[1...m], then an integer i is chosen, satisfying i &#x2264; n, n - i &lt; m, and we make our new r = r[1...i] + s[1...m]. This step might be taken for several times or not be taken at all.<br>What your spy brought back is the encrypted message r, you should solve for the minimal possible length of s (which is enough for your tactical actions).","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are several test cases.<br>For each test case there is a single line containing only one string r (The length of r does not exceed 10<sup>5</sup>).
