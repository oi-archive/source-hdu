Gameplay in the series often centers around jumping on and defeating enemies. The games usually feature simple plots; the most common theme is that of Bowser, the primary antagonist, kidnapping Princess Peach, whom Mario saves. Despite the plots usually being very simple, the Mario role-playing games tend to have deeper plots, often involving enemies other than Bowser (many of which involve Bowser actually teaming up with Mario), with aspirations for world domination. Mario has been featured in 200 games, and the series has sold over 200 million copies total, making it the best-selling video game series of all time.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C362-1004-1.jpg\"></center> <br>Today,Mario comes to a forest,whick has many apple trees.These trees are special,the apples are grown in the nodes of the tree,whick is shown as follow.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C362-1004-2.jpg\"></center> <br>Numbers in the nodes indicate the amount of apples which are also in this node.
