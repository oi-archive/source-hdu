All your feelings were seen by me, let me warm your face !<br>Today, we assume a lonely star is a cuboid of integral dimensions l<sub>x</sub> &#xD7; l<sub>y</sub> &#xD7; l<sub>z</sub> . The edges of the star are axis-aligned, and one corner of the star is located at position (0, 0, 0). Given the coordinates (x, y, z) of some arbitrary position on the surface of the lonely star, your goal is to return the square of the length of the shortest path along the star&#x2019;s surface from (0, 0, 0) to (x, y, z).<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C172-1005-1.jpg\"></center>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input test file will contain multiple test cases, each of which consists of six integers l<sub>x</sub>, l<sub>y</sub> , l<sub>z</sub> , x, y, z where 1 &#x2264;l<sub>x</sub>, l<sub>y</sub> , l<sub>z</sub> &#x2264; 1000. Note that the star may have zero volume, but the point (x, y, z) is always guaranteed to be on one of the six sides of the star.
