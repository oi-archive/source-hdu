In a universe with D dimension(s), ZCC finds D segments floating in the air. To be more precise: if we build a rectangular coordinate system with D axis, each of the segments is parallel with one axis, whose endpoints have a coordination of which all components belong to the set {x&#x2208;Z|0&#x2264;x&#xFF1C;N}. For each axis, there is exactly one segment parallel with it.<br>   Each of the D segments changes location every second. Read the pseudo code below for more details:<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C503-1002-1.jpg\"></center><br>   Every second, from every pair of segments intersect, ZCC acquires a unit of Energy.
