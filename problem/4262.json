However, as my rather elaborate act ends, I wish to drop all of the objects in a specific order, in a minimal amount of time. On each move, I can either rotate all of the objects counterclockwise by one, clockwise by one, or drop the object currently in my hand. If I drop the object currently in my hand, the next object (clockwise) will fall into my hand. What&#x2019;s the minimum number of moves it takes to drop all of the balls I&#x2019;m juggling?","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There will be several test cases in the input. Each test case begins with an integer <strong>n</strong>, (1&#x2264;<strong>n</strong>&#x2264;100,000) on its own line, indicating the total number of balls begin juggled. Each of the next n lines consists of a single integer, <strong>k</strong><sub>i</sub> (1&#x2264;<strong>k</strong><sub>i</sub>&#x2264;<strong>n</strong>), which describes a single ball: i is the position of the ball starting clockwise from the juggler&#x2019;s hand, and <strong>k</strong><sub>i</sub> is the order in which the ball should be dropped. The set of numbers {<strong>k</strong><sub>1</sub>, <strong>k</strong><sub>2</sub>, &#x2026;, <strong>k</strong><sub>n</sub>} is guaranteed to be a permutation of the numbers 1..<strong>n</strong>. The input will terminate with a line containing a single 0.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output a single integer on its own line, indicating the minimum number of moves I need to drop all of the balls in the desired order.
