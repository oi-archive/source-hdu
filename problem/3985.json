In the last battle, the D.A. has contributed greatly to smashing the Death Eater. Before this, Harry Potter had trained them a lot about defensing against the Dark Arts.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C360-1004-1.jpg\"></center><br>For easy recognizing, each of the D.A. has a unique ID, from 1 to N. At ordinary time, they lined up by a certain order. But in Harry&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s memory, there was one day they messed up, so he asked them to change their position. At first, he use the magic to remember all pairs, e.g. if the i-th ID is pi, Harry would commit the pair to memory. Then, in each round, he would require the pi-th magician to stand in the i-th place. By doing this again and again, after exactly K round, he found the ID sequence is the same as the original, and what&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s more, it&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s the first time they all come back!<br>But unfortunately, Harry can&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;t remember the ID sequence on that day, so he asks you for help, to calculate the number of permutations fitting this situation.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer T, indicating the number of test cases.<br>Each test case contains two integers, N and K.<br><br>Technical Specification<br><br>1. 1 &lt;= T &lt;= 50<br>2. 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100<br>3. 1 &lt;= K &lt;= 1 000 000 000<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output the case number first, then the answer mod 1 000 000 007.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n1 1\n3 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case 1: 1\nCase 2: 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"iSea@WHU","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2011+Multi-University+Training+Contest+15+-+Host+by+WHU&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2011 Multi-University Training Contest 15 - Host by WHU </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
