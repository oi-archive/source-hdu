For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, &#x3C6;(9)=6. <br>HG is the master of X Y. One day HG wants to teachers XY something about Euler&apos;s Totient function by a mathematic game. That is HG gives a positive integer N and XY tells his master the value of 2&lt;=n&lt;=N for which &#x3C6;(n) is a maximum. Soon HG finds that this seems a little easy for XY who is a primer of Lupus, because XY gives the right answer very fast by a small program. So HG makes some changes. For this time XY will tells him the value of 2&lt;=n&lt;=N for which n/&#x3C6;(n) is a maximum. This time XY meets some difficult because he has no enough knowledge to solve this problem. Now he needs your help. ","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are T test cases (1&lt;=T&lt;=50000).
