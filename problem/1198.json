The farm land is a rectangle, and is divided into a lot of samll squares. Water pipes are placed in these squares. Different square has a different type of pipe. There are 11 types of pipes, which is marked from A to K, as Figure 1 shows.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"/data/images/1121-1.gif\"></center><br><center>Figure 1</center><br><br>Benny has a map of his farm, which is an array of marks denoting the distribution of water pipes over the whole farm.

If water flow crosses one square, the whole farm land in this square is irrigated and will have a good harvest in autumn. <br><br>Now Benny wants to know at least how many wellsprings should be found to have the whole farm land irrigated.
