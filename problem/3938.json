Unfortunately, making a pair of portals will cost min{T} energies. T in a path between point V and point U is the length of the longest edge in the path. There may be lots of paths between two points. Now ZLGG owned L energies and he want to know how many kind of path he could make.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
