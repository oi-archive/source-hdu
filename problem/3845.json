Unfortunately, opening the tomb turns out to be a bad idea: all of a sudden, what was just a few moments ago an empty desert has now become a desert crawling with grumpy mummies (you would be grumpy too if you were suddenly awakened after a few thousand years of peaceful sleep).(Fortunately, after solving this problem, you woke up safe and sound in a hotel room in Florida. The enraged mummies had just been a dream.<br>Or had they?)<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/3845-1.jpg\"></center> <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases.
