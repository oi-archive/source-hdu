One day, MZL was playing with her favorite data structure, strings.<br><br>MZL is really like $Fibonacci~Sequence$, so she defines $Fibonacci~Strings$ in the similar way. The definition of $Fibonacci~Strings$ is given below.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;1) $fib_1 = b$<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;2) $fib_2 = a$<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;3) $fib_i = fib_{i - 1}fib_{i - 2},~i &gt; 2$<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>For instance, $fib_3 = ab,~fib_4 = aba,~fib_5 = abaab$.<br><br>Assume that a string $s$ whose length is $n$ is $s_1s_2s_3...s_n$. Then $s_is_{i + 1}s_{i + 2}s_{i + 3}...s_j$ is called as a substring of $s$, which is written as $s[i : j]$.<br><br>Assume that $i &lt; n$. If $s[1 : i] = s[n - i + 1 : n]$, then $s[1 : i]$ is called as a $Border$ of $s$. In $Borders$ of $s$, the longest $Border$ is called as $s$&apos; $LBorder$. Moreover, $s[1 : i]$&apos;s $LBorder$ is called as $LBorder_i$.<br><br>Now you are given 2 numbers $n$ and $m$. MZL wonders what $LBorder_m$ of $fib_n$ is. For the number can be very big, you should just output the number modulo $258280327(=2 \\times 3 ^ {17} + 1)$.<br><br>Note that $1\\leq T\\leq 100,~1\\leq n\\leq 10^3,~1\\leq m\\leq |fib_n|$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input is a number $T$, which means the number of test cases.<br><br>Then for the following $T$ lines, each has two positive integers $n$ and $m$, whose meanings are described in the description.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"The output consists of $T$ lines.
