Given a point (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) inside the polygon that moves with the polygon, determine when the liquid reaches the point. <br><br>The border between air and liquid always has y-coordinate 0, and the liquid only eats away from the sides of the polygon in 2 dimensions. The polygon does not rotate as it is lowered into the liquid, and at time 0, it is not touching the liquid. <br><br>Unlike the polygon, which is flat (2-dimensional), the liquid exists in three dimensions. Therefore, the liquid seeps into cavities in the polygon. For example, if the polygon is &quot;cup-shaped&quot;, the liquid can get &quot;inside&quot; the cup, as in the diagram below.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C240-1009-2.jpg\"></center>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases. <br><br>The first line of each test case contains the five integers <i>N, x, y, v,</i> and <i>c</i>, where 3 &lt;= <i>N</i> &lt;= 30, -100 &lt;= <i>x</i> &lt;= 100, 1 &lt;= <i>y</i> &lt;= 100, and 1 &lt;= <i>c</i> &lt; <i>v</i> &lt;= 10. <br><br>The following <i>N</i> lines of the test case each contain one vertex of the polygon.
