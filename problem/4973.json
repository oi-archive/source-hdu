These cells are put in a queue, the i-th cell belongs to type i. Each time I can use mitogen to double the cells in the interval [l, r]. For instance, the original queue is {1 2 3 3 4 5}, after using a mitogen in the interval [2, 5] the queue will be {1 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 4 5}. After some operations this queue could become very long, and I can&#x2019;t figure out maximum count of cells of same type.
