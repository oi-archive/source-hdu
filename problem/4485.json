For example,<br><br>7829<sub>10</sub>    mod  9  =  8,<br>37777777777777773<sub>8</sub>   mod  7  =  6<br>123456<sub>7</sub>   mod  6  = 3  <br><br>(Note that  37777777777777773<sub>8</sub>   =  1125899906842619<sub>10</sub>   and  123456<sub>7</sub>   =  22875<sub>10</sub>.) <br><br>Your job is to write a program that reads integer values in various bases and computes the remainder after dividing these values by one less than the input base.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The  first line of input contains a single integer P, (1 &lt;= P &lt;= 1000) , which is the number o  data sets that  follow.  Each data set should be processed identically and independently.<br><br>Each data set consists of  a single line of  input containing three space-separated values.  The  first is an integer which is the data set number.  The second is an integer which is the number, B  (2  &lt;=  B &lt;=  10), denoting a numeric base.  The third is an unsigned number, D,  in base B representation. For this problem, the number of  numeric characters in D will be limited to 10,000,000.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each data set there is a single line of  output.  It contains the data set number followed by a single space which is then  followed by the remainder resulting from dividing D by (B-1).<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">4\n1 10 7829\n2 7 123456\n3 6 432504023545112\n4 8 37777777777777773 </div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1 8\n2 3\n3 1\n4 6</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=Greater+New+York+2012&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> Greater New York 2012 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
