There are $n$ soldiers in this army. Each soldier should be in one of the two occupations, Mage or  Warrior. There are $m$ pairs of soldiers having combination ability. There are three kinds of combination ability. If the two soldiers in a pair are both Warriors, the army power would be increased by $a$. If the two soldiers in a pair are both Mages, the army power would be increased by $c$. Otherwise the army power would be increased by $b$, and $b = a / 4 + c / 3$, guaranteed that $4 | a$ and $3 | c$. Your task is to output the maximum power Bob can increase by arranging the soldiers&apos; occupations.<br><br>Note that the symbol $a | b$ means that $a$ divides $b$, e.g. , $3|12$ and $8|24$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.<br><br>Each case starts with a line containing two positive integers $n(n \\leq 500)$ and $m(m \\leq 10^4)$.<br><br>In the following $m$ lines, each line contains five positive integers $u, \\; v, \\; a, \\; b, \\; c$ $(1 \\leq u, v \\leq n, u \\neq v, 1 \\leq a, c \\leq 4 \\times 10 ^6, b = a / 4 + c / 3)$, denoting soldiers $u$ and $v$ have combination ability, guaranteed that the pair $(u,v)$ would not appear more than once.<br><br>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ in all test cases is no larger than $5 \\times 10^3$, and the sum of $m$ in all test cases is no larger than $5 \\times 10^4$.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one line containing the maximum power Bob can increase by arranging the soldiers&apos; occupations.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3 2\n1 2 8 3 3\n2 3 4 3 6</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">12</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2019+Multi-University+Training+Contest+2&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2019 Multi-University Training Contest 2 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
