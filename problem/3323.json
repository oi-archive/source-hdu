Now, if he has a way to access someone&#x2019;s computer, the computers those connected directly or indirectly will suddenly be broken. To avoid it happening, the government set several computers with &#x201C;Security Center&#x201D;. These computers can prevent wyh&#x2019;s attack. So they are called anti-wyhs. What&#x2019;s more, anti-wyhs can protect the computers those connect to them directly or indirectly from wyh&#x2019;s dreadful attack. But anti-wyhs can&#x2019;t connect to a computer indirectly through wyh&#x2019;s computer.<br><br>Now, the government asks you how many computers have been attacked.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input will start with a line giving the number of test cases, T.<br>The first line of each case contains three integers n (0&lt;n&lt;20000), m (0&lt;m&lt;50000) and c(0&lt;=c&lt;=n-1) meaning the number of the computers including wyh&#x2019;s, the number of those computers connect directly and the number of anti-wyhs. The second line contains c+1 integers. The first integer is the ID number of wyh&#x2019;s computer. The following integers are the ID numbers of anti-wyhs. The ID number is numbered from 0 to n-1. Then m lines follow. Each line contain two integers x, y. This means that the computer x and y are connected directly.<br><br>Note, if computer x connects to computer y, computer y also can connect to computer x.
