An equilateral triangle is also a regular polygon with all angles measuring 60&#xB0;.<br>&#xB7; In an isosceles triangle, two sides are equal in length. An isosceles triangle also has two angles of the same measure; namely, the angles opposite to the two  sides of the same length; this fact is the content of the Isosceles triangle theorem.<br>&#xB7; In a scalene triangle, all sides are unequal. The three angles are also all different in measure. Some (but not all) scalene triangles are also right triangles.<br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C375-1009-1.jpg\"></center> ","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of input contains an integer (1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100), the number of test cases.
