You need find the summation of the beauty of all the sub-sequence of $A$. As the answer may be very large, print it modulo $10^9+7$.<br><br>Note: In mathematics, a sub-sequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example $\\{1,3,2\\}$ is a sub-sequence of $\\{1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 1\\}$.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.
