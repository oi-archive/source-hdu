Every site is given a value which equals to the sum of ASCII values of all characters in the URL. For example aa.cc has value of 438 because 438 = 97 + 97 + 46 + 99 + 99. You just need to print the largest value amongst all values of sites.<br>Things are simplified because you found that all entries in your browsing history are of the following format: [domain], where [domain] consists of lower-case Latin letters and &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;.&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; only.
