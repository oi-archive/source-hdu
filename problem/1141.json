(Amtel released a 64-bit computer in 2000, a 32-bit computer in 1990, a 16-bit computer in 1980, an 8-bit computer in 1970, and a 4-bit computer, its first, in 1960.) <br>Amtel will use a new benchmark - the Factstone - to advertise the vastly improved capacity of its new chips. The Factstone rating is defined to be the largest integer n such that n! can be represented as an unsigned integer in a computer word. <br><br>Given a year 1960 &#x2264; y &#x2264; 2160, what will be the Factstone rating of Amtel&apos;s most recently released chip? <br><br>There are several test cases. For each test case, there is one line of input containing y. A line containing 0 follows the last test case. For each test case, output a line giving the Factstone rating. <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1960\n1981\n0</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n8</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=University+of+Waterloo+Local+Contest+2005.09.24&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> University of Waterloo Local Contest 2005.09.24 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
