The resulting graph has one less edge than G . A graph H is a minor of a graph G if a copy of H can be obtained from G via repeated edge deletion, edge contraction and isolated node deletion. <br><br>Minors play an important role in graph theory. For example, every non-planar graph contains either the graph K3, 3 (i.e., the complete bipartite graph on two sets of three vertices) or the complete graph K5 as a graph minor. <br><br>Write a program to find a graph minor Kn, m or Kn in an undirected connected simple graph. <br><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases.
