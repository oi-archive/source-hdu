They enjoy challenging each other with interesting geometry problems. One day, LMY puts a circle and a triangle on a plane. Then YY moves them. They find that the overlapping area of the circle and the triangle varies as the relative position between the two changes. LMY and YY want to find out the largest common area.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Input consists of one or more lines.
