Betting on the races was a popular pastime with many of the watchers on Tatooine and it was through Qui-Gon Jinn&apos;s bet with Watto that Skywalker would win the race that Skywalker was freed.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; Wookieepedia<br><br>Here comes the most awesome racing in the universe! Little Anakin sits in his own podracer, breathing deeply. He must win.<br><br>The real podracing is deadly. In this circular track (again $L$ in length), participants start in distinct locations and race with distinct speeds (the speed can be positive and minus, which means running clockwise and counterclockwise). Every podracer is equipped with a powerful weapon system respectively -- all for triumphing over enemies!!! yes! enemies!<br><br>If two competitors meet, which means that they reach an identical location simultaneously, the one with less powerful weapon system will be destroyed and be knocked out of the racing -- dead or alive. The power of the $i$-th participant is exactly $i$, and because each person runs with a distinct speed, so there must be a winner. <br><br>The racing stops when there is only one person still running in the track -- our winner! The others are crushed into pieces.<br><br>Little Anakin wants to know, when the racing will stop.
