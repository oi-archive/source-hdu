He had arrived Xipu bus station at $(T=0)$.He would like take a bus or walk, for details, it takes $A$ minutes to take a bus while $B$ minutes to walk($A&lt;B$ will be hold).There are $N$ bus lines all can take Tongjiang to UESTC, But as it was getting late,some bus lines may had already stopped running. Properly speaking, the bus line  have a probability of $(1-\\frac{L_i}{M})$ that it had already stopped running and no more bus will come to Xipu station, and a probability of  $(\\frac{L_i}{M}$)  that there will be a bus come to Xipu station to take Tongjiang to UESTC. And in the second case the bus may arrive at bus station at any time $T$, which holds $(0 \\leq T \\leq Li)$, with equal probability. Tongjiang is a smart boy, he had $Q$ different strategy to wait bus. Under strategy $i$ He would set a latest time point $T_i$ first. Then he started waiting for bus and take the first bus come to station who can take him to school or when time come to $(T=T_i)$ and still no bus come, he would start walk to school.$\\\\$<br>Now, Tongjiang wonders under each strategy, what&apos;s the expect time he arrive at school.<br><br>For all bus line $i$,  $( \\frac{1}{3}  M \\leq L_i \\leq \\frac{2}{3} M )$<br><br>For all strategy $i$,  $( Min(L_1,L_2...L_N) \\leq T_i \\leq Max(L_1,L_2...L_N) )$<br><br>$(6 \\leq M \\leq 100000)$<br><br>$(1 \\leq A,B\\leq 100000)$<br><br>$(2 \\leq N \\leq 12)$<br><br>$(1 \\leq Q \\leq 100000 )$<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"First line five positive integer $N,Q,M,A$ and $B$.<br>Second line N positive integer $(L_1,L_2...L_N)$<br>Then $Q$ lines following,each line contains one integer means a latest time point $T_i$.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each strategy,print one line with you answer.<br>Your answer will be considered to be right if<br>$\\min{\\left\\{\\left|yourans-stdans\\right|, \\left|\\frac{yourans-stdans}{stdans}\\right|\\right\\}} &lt; 10^{-4}$<br> <br>$(min(abs(yourans-stdans),abs(\\frac{yourans-stdans}{stdans})&lt;1e-4)$.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2 2 6 1 2\n2 4\n2\n3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2.851852\n3.129630</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2018+Multi-University+Training+Contest+7&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2018 Multi-University Training Contest 7 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
