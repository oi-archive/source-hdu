Now you are to find minimum spanning tree of this graph.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer T (1&lt;= T &lt;=10), the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of one line containing an integer N (2&lt;=N&lt;=200000).","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, you must output exactly 2 lines. You must print the weight of the minimum spanning tree in the 1st line. In the 2nd line, you must print N-1 space-separated integers f2, f3, &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; , fN, implying there is an edge between i and fi in your tree(2&lt;=i&lt;=N). If there are multiple solutions you must output the lexicographically smallest one. A tree T1 is lexicographically smaller than tree T2, if and only if the sequence f obtained by T1 is lexicographically smaller than the sequence obtained by T2.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n3\n2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n1 1\n0\n1\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nIn the 1st test case, w(1, 2) = w(2, 1) = 0, w(1, 3) = w(3, 1) = 1, w(2, 3) = w(3, 2) = 2.
