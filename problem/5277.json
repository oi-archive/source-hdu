One night he looked up to the sky and realised that the sky can be abstracted as a plane G and the stars can be abstracted as some points in the plane. <br>He labeled the points from $1$ to $n$. Also, he couldn&apos;t find a line crossing three points. YJC connected some points with some segments. But he made sure the segments wouldn&apos;t cross each other. YJC is extremely interested in some subsets of the points in which every two points are connected. He wants to find the subsets with maximum points and count them.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Multiple tests.<br><br>For each test:<br><br>The first line lie two integers $n,m$,indicating the number of points and the number of segments in G.<br>The next $n$ lines each line lie two integers $x,y$, indicating the coordinates of the $i$th point.<br>The next $m$ lines each line lie two integers $u,v$, indicating an segment (u,v).<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test:<br><br>Two integers sz and sum, representing the number of the maximum points and the number of the maximum subsets.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2 1\n1 1\n2 2\n1 2\n3 3\n1 1\n2 2\n4 5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2 1\n3 1\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>$1 \\leq n \\leq 1000$ $1 \\leq T \\leq 5$(T represents the number of testcases)\nIt is guaranteed that no two edges or points are exactly the same and $u \\neq v$.\n$-1e9 \\leq x,y \\leq 1e9$</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=BestCoder+Round+%2346&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> BestCoder Round #46 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
