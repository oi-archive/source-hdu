Each of the four has a square-shaped suitcase with side length Ai (1&lt;=i&lt;=4) respectively. They want to pack their suitcases into a large square box. The heights of the large box as well as the four suitcases are exactly the same. So they only need to consider the large box&#x2019;s side length. Of course, you should write a program to output the minimum side length of the large box, so that the four suitcases can be put into the box without overlapping.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Each test case contains only one line containing 4 integers Ai (1&lt;=i&lt;=4, 1&lt;=Ai&lt;=1,000,000,000) indicating the side length of each suitcase.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, display a single line containing the case number and the minimum side length of the large box required.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case 1: 4\nCase 2: 4\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nFor the first case, all suitcases have size 2x2.
