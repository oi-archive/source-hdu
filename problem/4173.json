After the party, however, it will be late, and the contestants will be too tired to walk a long way home. In particular, each contestant refuses to come to the party if it is more than 2.5 km from his or her house. <br>The solution is to hold the party as close to as many of the contestants&apos; houses as possible. This is where you come in: your job is to determine the optimal location for the party, so that as many contestants as possible will be willing to attend it. <br><br>We consider the city to be a flat square, 50 km on each side. A contestant can walk directly from the party in a straight line to his or her house (there are no obstacles). <br><br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"Input consists of a number of cases.<br>For each case, first there is a positive number N, which means the number of the contestants, and then N lines following, each line containing two floating point numbers indicating the (x,y) coordinates of the house of one of the contestants.
