Luckily, their classrooms and dormitories are at different places. The only chance for them to meet each other is on their way to classrooms from dormitories. <br>To simple this question, we can assume that the map of school is a normal rectangular 2D net. WNJXYK&#x2019;s dormitory located at (0,y1) and his classroom located at (x1,0). Destinys&#x2019;s dormitory located at (0,y2) and his classroom is located at (x2,0). On their way to classrooms, they can do two kinds of movement : (x,y)-&gt;(x,y-1) and (x,y)-&gt;(x+1,y). <br>WNJXYK does not want to meet Destinys so that he thinks that it is not <b>safe</b> to let his path to classroom from dormitory has any intersect point with Destinys &#x2018;s. And then he wonders how many different paths for WNJXYK and Destinys arriving their classrooms from dormitories <b>safely</b>.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input starts with one line contains exactly one positive integer $T$ which is the number of test cases.<br>Each test case contains one line with four positive integers $x1$,$x2$,$y1$,$y2$ which has been explained above.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one line containing &#x201C;y&#x201D; where y is the number of different paths modulo 10^9+7.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n1 2 1 2\n2 3 2 4\n4 9 3 13</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n60\n16886100\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nT&lt;=1000\nx1&lt;x2,y1&lt;y2\n0&lt;x1,x2,y1,y2&lt;=100000\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2018+%BA%DA%C1%FA%BD%AD%CA%A1%B4%F3%D1%A7%C9%FA%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%BE%BA%C8%FC&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2018 &#x9ED1;&#x9F99;&#x6C5F;&#x7701;&#x5927;&#x5B66;&#x751F;&#x7A0B;&#x5E8F;&#x8BBE;&#x8BA1;&#x7ADE;&#x8D5B; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
