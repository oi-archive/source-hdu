So he wants to make the chessboard much bigger. Although Little Z insists the original version, Little X stands by Little Y. After they enlarge the chessboard, the chessboard turns to an infinite line. <br>The chessboard is like the Number Axes now, with each integer point able to hold a checker. At initial status there are three checkers on three different integer points , and through the game there always are three checkers. Every time, they can choose a checker A to jump across a pivot checker B to a new position(but the distance between old A and B equals to new A and B, and there should be no other checkers except B in the range [old A, new A]).<br>After playing for a while, they wonder whether an given status a,b,c can be transferred to x,y,z. obeying the rules. Since the checkers are considered the same, it is unnecessary for a must jump to x. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line is a,b,c.<br>The second line is x,y,z.<br>They are all integers in range (-10^9, 10^9) and the two status are valid.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"The first line is YES or NO, showing whether the transfer can be achieved.<br>If it is YES, then output the least steps in the second line.<br>","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1 2 3\n0 3 5</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">YES\n2\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>The middle checker jumps to position 0, and the status is 0 1 3\nThen , the middle one jumps to 5.</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2011+Multi-University+Training+Contest+1+-+Host+by+HNU&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2011 Multi-University Training Contest 1 - Host by HNU </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
