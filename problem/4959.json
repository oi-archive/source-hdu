Recently, he got a sequence Ln from his teacher. Ln is defined as follow:<br>$$\\Large L(n)=\\begin{cases}<br>2 &amp; \\text{ if } n=0  \\\\ <br>1 &amp; \\text{ if } n=1  \\\\ <br>L(n-1)+L(n-2) &amp; \\text{ if } n&gt;1  <br>\\end{cases}$$<br>And Akagi&#x2019;s teacher cherishes Agaki&#x2019;s talent in mathematic. So he wants Agaki to spend more time studying math rather than playing basketball. So he decided to ask Agaki to solve a problem about Ln and promised that as soon as he solves this problem, he can go to play basketball. And this problem is: <br>Given N and K, you need to find \\(\\Large\\sum\\limits_{0}^{N}L_i^K\\)<br><br>And Agaki needs your help.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"This problem contains multiple tests.<br>In the first line there&#x2019;s one number T (1 &#x2264; T &#x2264; 20) which tells the total number of test cases.
