Your initial energy is zero. You can play up to K times the game, every time you can choose any one of the grid as a starting point (but not traveled before) then you can choose a grid on the right or below the current grid to jump, but it has not traveled before. Every time you can jump as many times as you want, as long as you do not violate rules. If you are from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2), then you consume |x1-x2|+|y1-y2|-1 energies. Energy can be negative. <br>   However, in a jump, if you start position and end position has same numbers S, then you can increase the energy value by S. <br>   Give me the maximum energy you can get. Notice that you have to go each grid exactly once and you don&#x2019;t have to play exactly K times.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The first line is an integer T, stands for the number of the text cases.<br>   Then T cases followed and each case begin with three numbers N, M and K.
