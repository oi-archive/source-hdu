The wall can be considered as a line consisting of n nodes. Each node has its own color.<br><br>Xenocide spends all day in front of the wall. Sometimes, he paints some consecutive nodes so that these nodes have the same color. When he feels tired, he focuses on a particular color and counts the number of nodes that have this color within a given interval.<br><br>Now Xenocide is tired of counting, so he turns to you for help.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several test cases.<br>The first line of each test case contains two integer n, m(1&lt;=n, m&lt;=100000) indicating the length of the wall and the number of queries.<br>The following line contains N integers which describe the original color of every position.<br>Then m lines follow. Each line contains 4 non-negative integers a, l, r, z(1&lt;=a&lt;=2, 0&lt;=l&lt;=r&lt;n ,<strong>0&lt;=z&lt;2<sup>31</sup></strong>).<br>a = 1 indicates that Xenocide paints nodes between l and r and the resulting color is z.<br>a = 2 indicates that Xenocide wants to know how many nodes between l and r have the color z.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Print the corresponding answer for each queries.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">5 5\n1 2 3 4 0\n2 1 3 3\n1 1 3 1\n2 1 3 3\n2 0 3 1\n2 3 4 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n0\n4\n1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2012+Multi-University+Training+Contest+10&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2012 Multi-University Training Contest 10 </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
