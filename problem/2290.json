He had broken the prison and started a big runaway.<br>Scofield has a map of US with cities and bidirectional roads between them. The lengths of roads are known. Some cities get a lot of cops who are very troublesome. Now Scofield needs your help to arrange his runaway route.<br><br>He needs a shortest path between two cities, while the quantity of the police in any city, except the start city and end city, on the route is no more than k.<br><br>You should know that it is very hard to escape.
