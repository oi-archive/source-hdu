How many points can you get? Now, I told you the rules which are used in this course.<br>There are 5 problems in this final exam. And I will give you 100 points if you can solve all 5 problems; of course, it is fairly difficulty for many of you. If you can solve 4 problems, you can also get a high score 95 or 90 (you can get the former(&#x1F0;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;) only when your rank is in the first half of all students who solve 4 problems).
