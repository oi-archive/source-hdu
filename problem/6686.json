According to past experiences, contradictions always arose when they were planning for the same trip. This time, they decide to make plans dividually and will go travel twice.<br><br>Coincidentally, they choose the same country Fantasy as the destination, which is a small island country on the Pacific. There are $n$ cities in Fantasy and they are connected with $n-1$ two-way roads. It is guaranteed that any two cities can reach each other by the road system.<br><br>Though Rikka and Yuta love travels, visiting the same city more than once is still boring for them. Therefore, both Rikka and Yuta choose a simple path (i.e., a path without visiting any city more than once) as her/his plan. Moreover, they want to ensure the two paths do not intersect on any city.<br><br>Suppose Rikka chooses the path from $a$ to $b$, Yuta chooses the path from $c$ to $d$ (both $a=b$ and $c=d$ are allowed), they define the feature of the plan is an ordered pair $(L(a,b),L(c,d))$, where $L(x,y)$ represents the number of cities on the path from $x$ to $y$.<br><br>Now, Rikka wants to count the number of different features, i.e., the number of different integer pairs $(l_1,l_2)$ which satisfies there exists a valid travel plan $(a,b,c,d)$ meets $L(a,b) = l_1, L(c,d) = l_2$. Since Rikka and Yuta are busy with planning their trip, Rikka asks you to help her calculate the answer.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains a single integer $T(1 \\leq T \\leq 300)$, the number of test cases.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains a single integer $n(1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5)$, the number of cities in Fantasy.<br><br>Then $n-1$ lines follow.
