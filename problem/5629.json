One day, Clarke turned into a CS, did a research on data structure.  <br>Now Clarke has $n$ nodes, he knows the degree of each node no more than $a_i$. He wants to know the number of ways to choose some nodes to compose to a tree of size $s(1 \\le s \\le n)$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains one integer $T(1 \\le T \\le 10)$, the number of test cases.  <br>For each test case:  <br>The first line contains an integer $n(2 \\le n \\le 50)$.  <br>Then a new line follow with $n$ numbers. The $i$th number $a_i(1 \\le a_i &lt; n)$ denotes the number that the degree of the $i$th node must no more than $a_i$.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print a line with $n$ integers.
