For the sake of simplicity, a DNA is represented as a string containing characters &apos;A&apos;, &apos;G&apos; , &apos;C&apos; and &apos;T&apos;. The repairing techniques are simply to change some characters to eliminate all segments causing diseases. For example, we can repair a DNA &quot;AAGCAG&quot; to &quot;AGGCAC&quot; to eliminate the initial causing disease segments &quot;AAG&quot;, &quot;AGC&quot; and &quot;CAG&quot; by changing two characters. Note that the repaired DNA can still contain only characters &apos;A&apos;, &apos;G&apos;, &apos;C&apos; and &apos;T&apos;.<br><br>You are to help the biologists to repair a DNA by changing least number of characters.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing one integers N (1 &#x2264; N &#x2264; 50), which is the number of DNA segments causing inherited diseases.<br>The following N lines gives N non-empty strings of length not greater than 20 containing only characters in &quot;AGCT&quot;, which are the DNA segments causing inherited disease.<br>The last line of the test case is a non-empty string of length not greater than 1000 containing only characters in &quot;AGCT&quot;, which is the DNA to be repaired.<br><br>The last test case is followed by a line containing one zeros.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, print a line containing the test case number( beginning with 1) followed by the<br>number of characters which need to be changed.
