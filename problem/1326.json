He puts the bricks one upon another and builds stacks of different height. ``Look, I&apos;ve built a wall!&apos;&apos;, he tells his older sister Alice. ``Nah, you should make all stacks the same height. Then you would have a real wall.&apos;&apos;, she retorts. After a little con- sideration, Bob sees that she is right. So he sets out to rearrange the bricks, one by one, such that all stacks are the same height afterwards. But since Bob is lazy he wants to do this with the minimum number of bricks moved. Can you help? <br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/1326-1.gif\"></center><br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of several data sets. Each set begins with a line containing the number n of stacks Bob has built. The next line contains n numbers, the heights hi of the n stacks. You may assume 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 50 and 1 &lt;= hi &lt;= 100.<br><br>The total number of bricks will be divisible by the number of stacks.
