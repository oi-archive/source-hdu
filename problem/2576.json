He thinks mathematics is very funny and beautiful.When he solved a math problem he would be very happy just like getting accepted in ACM.Recently, he find a very strange problem.Everyone know that the sum of sequence from 1 to n is     n*(n + 1)/2. But now if we create a sequence which consists of the sum of sequence from 1 to n. The new sequence is 1, 1+ 2, 1+2+3, .... 1+2+...+n. Now the problem is that what is the sum of the sequence from1 to  1+2+...+n .Is it very simple? I think you can solve it. Good luck!","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contain an integer T .Then T cases followed. Each case contain an integer n (1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10000000).
