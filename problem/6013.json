The index of the new point is the number of points already existing in the plane plus 1.<br><br>M l r x y: indicates that the points whose index belong to $[l, r]$ moved $x$ units right and $y$ units up.<br><br>R l r x y a: indicates that the points whose index belong to $[l, r]$ were rotated counterclockwise by the angle $a$. the rotation center is $(x, y)$. $a$ is radian, and $a$ contains at most one decimal place.<br><br>F l r x y d: indicates that the points whose index belong to $[l, r]$ scaled d times, the scaling center is $(x, y)$.It&apos;s Guaranteed that $d\\in[0,1]$, and $d$ contains at most one decimal place.<br><br>Q id: Ask for the coordinates of the point whose index is $id$, output a line of two real numbers, separated by a space, Suppose the answers are x,y,you should use printf(&quot;%.0lf %.0lf\\n&quot;,floor(x),floor(y)); to output them.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input includes multiple test cases.
