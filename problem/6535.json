She is very interested in the volume of three-dimensional geometric shapes, so she decides to test you.<br>Before that, she is going to tell you definitions of the following two three-dimensional geometric shapes.<br><br><b>Oblique circular cone</b>: A cone whose surface is generated by lines joining a fixed point called the apex to the points of a circle, the fixed point lying on a line that is not perpendicular to the circle at its center. (The circular cone is a special kind of oblique circular cone.)<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C755-1004-1.png\"></center> <br><br><b>Pyramid</b>: A polyhedron formed by connecting a polygonal base and a point, called the apex. Each base edge and apex form a triangle, called a lateral face. It is a conic solid with polygonal base. A pyramid with an n-sided base has $n + 1$ vertices, $n + 1$ faces, and $2n$ edges.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C755-1004-2.png\"></center><br><br>Chika gives you an oblique circular cone and a pyramid placed in the space rectangular coordinate system. Their bottoms are on the plane $z=0$. The $z$-coordinates of their apexes are bigger than $0$. Some parts of them may overlap with each other. You need to help Chika to calculate the volume of the union of the two three-dimensional geometric shapes.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file contains several lines.<br>The first line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ $(z &gt; 0)$, which are the coordinates of the apex of the oblique circular cone.<br>The second row contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $r$ $(r &gt; 0)$. $x$ and $y$ are the $x$-coordinate and the $y$-coordinate of the center of the oblique circular cone&apos;s bottom circle. $r$ is radius of the oblique circular cones&apos;s bottom circle. <br>The third line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ $(z &gt; 0)$, which are the coordinates of the apex of the pyramid. <br>The fourth line contains a positive integer $n$ $(n \\leq 1000)$, which is the number of vertices of the pyramid&apos;s bottom polygon. <br>Then $n$ lines follow. Each line contains two integers $x$, $y$, which are the $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate of the $n$ vertices of the pyramid&apos;s bottom polygon. Vertex coordinates are given in counterclockwise order. These points do not coincide.<br>It is guaranteed that the absolute values of all input integers are not greater than $1000$.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"The output file should contain only one line, including one real number, representing the volume of the union of the oblique circular cone and the pyramid.
