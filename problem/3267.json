There are two players, a red color player R and a blue color player B. Initially all edges of G are uncolored. The two players alternately color an uncolored edge of G with their color until all edges are colored. The goal of B is that in the end, the blue-colored edges form a connected spanning subgraph of G. A connected spanning subgraph of G is a connected subgraph that contains all the vertexes of graph G. The goal of R is to prevent B from achieving his goal. <br><br>Assume that R starts the game. Suppose that both players play in the smartest way. Your task is to find out whether B will win the game.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input contains several test cases, ended by a line of &#x201C;-1 -1&#x201D;.<br>Each test case begins with a line of two integers n ( 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10) and m (0 &lt;= m &lt;= 30), indicating the number of vertexes and edges in the graph.

Each line contains two integers p and q ( 0 &lt;= p, q &lt; n) , indicating there is an edge between vertex p and vertex q. <br>It is possible that the graph contains more than one edge between two vertexes and self-loops.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case print a line which is either &quot;YES&quot; or &quot;NO&quot; indicating B will win the game or not.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3 4\n0 1\n1 2\n2 0\n0 2\n4 6\n1 0\n1 2\n2 0\n0 2\n3 0\n1 0\n-1 -1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">YES\nNO</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2009+Asia+Ningbo+Regional+Contest+Hosted+by+NIT+&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2009 Asia Ningbo Regional Contest Hosted by NIT  </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
