When he started to take advantage of Wolfram Alpha, a scientific computing tool, he fell in love with its current logo, a rhombic hexecontahedron, immediately.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C722-1011-1.jpg\"><br>Wolfram|Alpha Computational Intelligence$^{\\mathrm{TM}}$</center><br><br>The rhombic hexecontahedron is a beautiful polyhedron which has $60$ congruent rhombic faces. A rhombic hexecontahedron can be constructed from a regular dodecahedron, by taking its vertices, its face centers and its edge centers and scaling them in or out from the body center to different extents. Also, a rhombic hexecontahedron can be constructed from a regular icosahedron, by appending three rhombuses to each of its faces such that each rhombus shares a vertex with it and every two rhombuses share an edge.<br><br>John wants to make some origami of rhombic hexecontahedron. Before getting started from scratch, he was wondering in how many different ways he can make origami of at most $n$ types of colored paper. He has thought for a while and finally determined to leave this problem for you. Furthermore, he added some restriction such that a way of origami is counted if the number of faces colored by the $i$-th type of paper is at least $c_i$ $(i = 1, 2, \\cdots, n)$. Of course, the answer might be so large, so you just need to tell him the answer modulo some integer $p$.<br><br>Two ways are considered as the same if and only if there exists a way of rotation that can transform one to another so that each corresponding face has the same color. Here is an example of origami after coloring.<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C722-1011-2.jpg\"><br>Picture from Wolfram Mathworld</center> <br><br>In addition, he thought you might need a plane expansion for better understanding, however, because the plane expansion of a rhombic hexecontahedron is quite unreadable, he left here a modified plane expansion of a regular dodecahedron to illustrate approximately.
