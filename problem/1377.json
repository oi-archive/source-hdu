XML parsers must report anything that violates the rules of a well-formed XML document. An XML document is said to be well-formed if it meets all of the wellformedness constraints as defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) XML specification.<br><br>XML documents are composed of units called elements, that contain either character data and/or other elements.<br><br>Elements may also contain within their declaration values called attributes. Consider the following XML document: <br><br>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;<br>&lt;customer&gt;<br>       &lt;name&gt;<br>               &lt;first&gt;John&lt;/first&gt;<br>               &lt;last&gt;Doe&lt;/last&gt;<br>       &lt;/name&gt;<br>       &lt;address&gt;<br>               &lt;street&gt;<br>                       &lt;number&gt;15&lt;/number&gt;<br>                       &lt;direction&gt;West&lt;/direction&gt;<br>                       &lt;name&gt;34th&lt;/name&gt;<br>               &lt;/street&gt;<br>               &lt;city&gt;New York&lt;/city&gt;<br>               &lt;state-code&gt;NY&lt;/state-code&gt;<br>               &lt;zip-code format=&quot;PLUS4&quot;&gt;10001-0001&lt;/zip-code&gt;<br>               &lt;country-code&gt;USA&lt;/country-code&gt;<br>       &lt;/address&gt;<br>       &lt;orders/&gt;<br>&lt;/customer&gt;<br><br>The bold identifiers contained within angle brackets are the elements of the document. The italicized identifier &quot;format&quot; within the &quot;zip-code&quot; element is an attribute of that element. All elements, with the exception of &quot;orders&quot;, have a start and an end declaration, also called a tags. The &quot;orders&quot; element is an empty element, as indicated by the &quot;/&gt;&quot; sequence that closes the element, and does not require a separate end-tag. The first line is a processing instruction for an XML parser and is not considered an element of the document.<br><br>The rules for a well-formed document are:<br><br>1. There is exactly one element that is not contained within any other element. This element is identified as the &quot;root&quot; or &quot;document&quot; element. In the example above, &quot;customer&quot; is the document element.<br><br>2. The structure of an XML document must nest properly. An element&apos;s start-tag must be paired with a closing end-tag if it is a non-empty element.<br><br>3. The name in an element’s end-tag must match the element type in the start-tag. For example, an element opened with &lt;address&gt; must be closed by &lt;/address&gt;.<br><br>4. No attribute may appear more than once in the same start-tag or empty-element tag.<br><br>5. A parsed element must not contain a recursive reference to itself. For example, it is improper to include another address element within an address element.<br><br>6. A named attribute must have an associated value.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input file will contain a series of XML documents.
