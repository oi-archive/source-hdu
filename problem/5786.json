Now she rearrange the M sequences and connect them from left to right to get a new sequence. And she wanna know the sum of great common divisores of all different interval of the result sequence. She define the sum as beautiful value but it&apos;s not the answer. We can easy know there are M! different rearrangements. She want to calculate the sum of beautiful value of all rearragements. It&apos;s too difficult. So help her please.
