In steganography, which literally means &quot;hidden writing&quot;, the goal is to hide<br>the fact that a message has even been sent. It has been in use since 440 BC. Historical methods of steganography include invisible inks and tatooing messages on messengers where they can&apos;t easily be seen. A modern method is to encode a message using the least-significant bits of the RGB color values of pixels in a digital image.<br>For this problem you will uncover messages hidden in plain text. The spaces within the text encode bits; an odd number of consecutive spaces encodes a 0 and an even number of consecutive spaces encodes a 1. The<br>four texts in the example input below (terminated by asterisks) encode the following bit strings: 11111, 000010001101101, 01, and 000100010100010011111. Each group of five consecutive bits represents a<br>binary number in the range 0&#xFFFD;C31, which is converted to a character according to the table below. If the last group contains fewer than five bits, it is padded on the right with 0&apos;s.<br>&quot; &quot; (space) 0<br>&quot;A&quot; &#xFFFD;C &quot;Z&quot; 1&#xFFFD;C26<br>&quot;&apos;&quot; (apostrophe) 27<br>&quot;,&quot; (comma) 28<br>&quot;-&quot; (hyphen) 29<br>&quot;.&quot; (period) 30<br>&quot;?&quot; (question mark) 31<br>The first message is 11111<sub>2</sub> = 31<sub>10</sub> = &quot;?&quot;. The second message is (00001, 00011, 01101)<sub>2</sub> = (1, 3, 13)<sub>10</sub> =<br>&quot;ACM&quot;. The third message is 01000<sub>2</sub> = 8<sub>10</sub> = &quot;H&quot;, where the underlined 0&apos;s are padding bits. The fourth message is (00010, 00101, 00010, 01111, 10000)<sub>2</sub> = (2, 5, 2, 15, 16)<sub>10</sub> = &quot;BEBOP&quot;. <br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The input consists of one or more texts.
