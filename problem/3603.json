There are N teammates,the time(in second time) every teammate&#x2019;arrival make a number sequence with length N. In order to punish the laters,Coach Yehr give them a puzzle,Coach Yehr choose a subsequence from S<sub>a</sub>  to S<sub>b</sub> ,the laters must tell Coach Yehr the longest length of AC sequence in the subsequence as soon as possible.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiply text cases.You must deal with it until the end of file.<br>The first line of each test case is an interger N,indicates the number of ACM teammates;<br>The second line have N intergers,the i-th number indicates the i-th teammate&#x2019;s arrival time.<br>The third line is an interger M indicates Coach Yehr will ask M times;<br>The follow M lines,each line have two intergers a and b,indicate the interval of the sequence.<br>","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each query,you have to print the longest length of AC sequence in the subsequence in a single line.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">8\n3 2 5 6 8 3 2 6\n2\n2 4\n1 8\n6\n5 3 1 2 3 4\n1 6\n3 3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3\n5\n4\n2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Author","content":"dili","type":"source","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2010+ACM-ICPC+Multi-University+Training+Contest%A3%A817%A3%A9%A1%AA%A1%AAHost+by+ZSTU&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2010 ACM-ICPC Multi-University Training Contest&#xFF08;17&#xFF09;&#x2014;&#x2014;Host by ZSTU </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
