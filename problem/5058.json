There are n integers in each file. Small W wants to know whether these two files are same. So he invites you to write a program to check whether these two files are same. Small W thinks that two files are same when they have the same integer set.<br>For example file A contains (5,3,7,7),and file B contains (7,5,3,3). They have the same integer set (3,5,7), so they are same.<br>Another sample file C contains(2,5,2,5), and file D contains (2,5,2,3).<br>The integer set of C is (2,5),but the integer set of D is (2,3,5),so they are not same.<br>Now you are expected to write a program to compare two files with size of n.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Multi test cases (about 100).
