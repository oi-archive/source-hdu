The Power Square is n&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;n with integer values between 0 and n2-1.<br>A number y is a neighbor of another number x in the Power Square if y is directly above or below x, or directly to the left or right of x. Rosalina asks Super Mario to find all the numbers in the Power Square that are neighbors of the number 7, since she can tell that those numbers are quite nervous.<br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Why are the numbers scared of seven?&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; Mario asks Rosalina.<br>&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Because seven ate nine!&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; Rosalina exclaims.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"Input is a description of of the Power Square, followed by a number of commands. The first line is the size of the Power Square n. You may assume n&lt;=100. The second line contains the n2 values in the Power Square, separated by spaces.
