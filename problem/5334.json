Yuta is worrying about this situation, so he asks rikka to have some practice on codeforces. Then she opens the problem B:<br><br>Given an integer $K$, she needs to come up with an sequence of integers $A$ satisfying that the number of different continuous subsequence of $A$ is equal to $k$.<br><br>Two continuous subsequences $a,\\ b$ are different if and only if one of the following conditions is satisfied:<br><br>1. The length of $a$ is not equal to the length of $b$.<br><br>2. There is at least one $t$ that $a_{t} \\neq b_{t}$, where $a_{t}$ means the $t$-th element of $a$ and $b_{t}$ means the $t$-th element of $b$.<br><br>Unfortunately, it is too difficult for Rikka.
