There are N-1 paths between those steles so that the maze looks like a tree. An adventure team wants to explorer all paths of the maze. They decide to air-drop some members at those steles, and then those members begin their tour to explore. It costs K dollars to drop one member. Unfortunately, there are some bandits on some paths. They will rob C dollars if a member goes through that path. <b>No member could pass the same path twice, calculate the minimum cost to fully explore the maze. </b><br> The maze is considered fully explored if and only if all paths are explored by one of the members.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"   The first line of input contains only one integer T(&lt;=100), the number of test cases. <br><br>   For each case, the first line contains 2 integers, N(&lt;=500) and K(&lt;=1000) as described before.
