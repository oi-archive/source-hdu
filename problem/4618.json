For example, 1 2 3 2 1 is a palindrome sequence, but 1 2 3 2 2 is not. Given a 2-D array of N rows and M columns, your task is to find a maximum sub-array of P rows and P columns, of which each row and each column is a palindrome sequence.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;The first line of input contains only one integer, T, the number of test cases.
