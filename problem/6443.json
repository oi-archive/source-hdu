Inu has a box of energy crystals $B$.<br>Both of $A$ and $B$ have $n$ crystals. Each crystal has a different energy. You can think that energy is a positive integer.<br>Unfortunately, $A$ and $B$ are mixed together when Neko and Inu are playing games. Each pair of crystals $u (u \\in A)$ and $v (v \\in B)$ can produce two new crystals which energies are $u + v$ and $|u - v|$. The old crystals will disappear in the end.<br>So there are $2 n ^ {2}$ crystals finally. Let the new box of energy crystals called $C$. Neko and Inu are surprised to find each crystal in $C$ is different and their energies are continuous odd number from $1$ to $4 n ^ {2} - 1$.<br>Now, Neko and Inu want to know how many different $A$ and $B$ can be mixed into $C$. Calculate the answer after mod $998244353$.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains only one integer $T ( T \\leq 50)$, which indicates the number of test cases.   <br>For each test case, the first line contains one integer $m$ ,indicating the number of distinct primes of $n$.($1 \\leq m \\leq  10^5$).<br>The next $m$ line, each line contains two integers $p_{i}, a_{i}$.<br>Where $p_{i}$ is a prime.$n = \\prod p_{i} ^ {a_{i}}, a_{i} &gt; 0, \\sum a_{i} \\leq 10^5, p_{i} \\leq 10^9 + 9$.<br>There are at most $10$ test cases which satisfies $\\sum a_{i} \\geq 10^3$.","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"For each test case, output one line &quot;Case #x: y&quot;, where x is the case number (starting from 1) and y is the answer after mod $998244353$.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n1\n2 1\n2\n2 2\n5 2</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">Case #1: 6\nCase #2: 6060\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px\"><div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed\"><i>Hint</i></div>\nfor the first case:\nA = {1, 3}, B = {4, 12}\nA = {4, 12}, B = {1, 3}\nA = {3, 5}, B = {6, 10}\nA = {6, 10}, B = {3, 5}\nA = {2, 6}, B = {7, 9}\nA = {7, 9}, B = {2, 6}\n</div><i style=\"font-size:1px\"> </i></div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2018%D6%D0%B9%FA%B4%F3%D1%A7%C9%FA%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%BE%BA%C8%FC+-+%CD%F8%C2%E7%D1%A1%B0%CE%C8%FC&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2018&#xFFFD;&#x439;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x467;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x1BE;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; - &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x461;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
