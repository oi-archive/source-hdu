Sailormoon girls usually play these games in them spare time. They always play a mini game named THE GOLD MINNERS. Now they give you a problem about this game. Could you solve it? Now let&#x2019;s look at the following picture.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;<center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../data/images/C251-1004-1.jpg\"></center> <br>We set the position of the minner as the origin of coordinate.There are many objects in this game,not only gold. They also have diamonds,stones,and other unknown things.All the objects can be treated as polygon. Every two polygons can not intersect. In this problem,we will give you some data about the angle in order. When the hook with certain angle sinking, it will always catch nearest object, and get the corresponding money. There will be nothing in the position of this object later. If there have no objects,the hook will return back to the origin of coordinate. How much money does the minner have at last?Do you know?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are multiple test cases.<br>Each case begins with a positive integer N (0 &lt;= N &lt;= 30) , it means there are N objects.<br>The following N * 2 lines describe the informatin about objects.
