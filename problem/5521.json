However, after Farmer John decorated his<br>fences they were separated into different blocks. John&apos;s farm are divided into $n$ blocks labelled from $1$ to $n$.<br>Bessie lives in the first block while Elsie lives in the $n$-th one. They have a map of the farm<br>which shows that it takes they $t_i$ minutes to travel from a block in $E_i$ to another block<br>in $E_i$ where $E_i~(1\\le i\\le m)$ is a set of blocks. They want to know how soon they can meet each other<br>and which block should be chosen to have the meeting.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains an integer $T~(1\\le T\\le 6)$, the number of test cases. Then $T$ test cases<br>follow.<br><br>The first line of input contains $n$ and $m$. $2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$. The following $m$ lines describe the sets $E_i~(1\\le i\\le m)$. Each line will contain two integers $t_i(1 \\leq t_i \\leq 10^9)$ and $S_i~(S_i&gt;0)$ firstly. Then $S_i$ integer follows which are the labels of blocks in $E_i$.
