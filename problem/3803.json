One day, one giantarum called ac wants to ask something about the common point(s) of two given &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;Segments&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;. Each segment is described as two points in 2D.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;Of course, gxx says: &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;It&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;s a problem that could be killed in one second!&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; However, the giantarum ac does not know how to solve this problem, could you help him?","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"&#xA0;&#xA0;The first line contains one integer T, indicates the number of the test cases.
