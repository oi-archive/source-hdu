Because of special technical problem, all the coordinates are integers between $[0,2]$. The roads in this space are all parallel to the axis, so the distance between two sight spots is their Manhattan distance. More specifically, if the coordinate of one sight spot is $(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_m)$, and that of another sight spot is $(y_1,y_2,\\ldots,y_m)$, then their distance is $\\sum_{i=1}^{m}|x_i-y_i|$. JRY wants to establish some bus routes between two sight spots, so he needs to do some research first. For you, the problem is to find the total number of pairs $(x,y)$ for each $k$, that the distance between $(x,y)$ is $k$. Please be aware: 1. $(x,x)$ does not count; 2. $(x,y)$ and $(y, x)$ are identical, so that it is only one pair; 3. different sight spots may have same coordinates. <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input is a single integer $T\\ (T = 11)$, indicating the number of testcases. <br><br>For each testcase, the first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$.
