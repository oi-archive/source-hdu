It often comes up with charming shapes and ideas.<br>In this problem, our poor princess is trapped in a castle by some bad guys again, yeah, again. So, let&apos;s seize the chance to be a hero.<br>Right now, the beautiful princess is in the original point of a Cartesian coordinate system, for simplification, the castle is treated as a coordinate system, like a common computational geometry problem.<br>There is a bomb which can be exploded anytime, and it locates at (Xo, Yo) in the castle. To save the princess, we need design a route for her to leave away the bomb as far as possible. But she already has a plan written on her notebook, which contains some vectors, and she insists on escaping in the vectors&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; direction one by one, that is, if she is in point(0, 0), and the vector is (X, Y), she will be in point(X, Y) if she escapes in this vector.<br>You get her notebook now, and find princess&apos;s plan is a not a good plan sometimes. Then you decide to help the princess to make some slight modification, you can change the order of those vectors, and/or reverse some vectors, that is, change vector (X, Y) to vector (-X, -Y).<br>We want to know the maximum distance to the bomb after modification.<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains a single integer T, indicating the number of test cases.
