How to number them? And how to avoid their alpc-number conflicted? <br>Of course, we can number them one by one, but that&#x2019;s too bored! So ALPCs use another method called Fibonacci Check-up in spite of collision. <br><br>First you should multiply all digit of your studying number to get a number n (maybe huge).<br>Then use Fibonacci Check-up!<br>Fibonacci sequence is well-known to everyone. People define Fibonacci sequence as follows: F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1. F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), n&gt;=2. It&#x2019;s easy for us to calculate F(n) mod m. <br>But in this method we make the problem has more challenge. We calculate the formula  <img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/convip2-1003-1.jpg\">,   is the combination number. The answer mod m (the total number of alpc team members) is just your alpc-number.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"First line is the testcase T.<br>Following T lines, each line is two integers n, m ( 0&lt;= n &lt;= 10^9, 1 &lt;= m &lt;= 30000 )","type":"input_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Output","content":"Output the alpc-number.","type":"output_format","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">2\n1 30000\n2 30000</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html"},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2009+Multi-University+Training+Contest+5+-+Host+by+NUDT&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2009 Multi-University Training Contest 5 - Host by NUDT </a> ","type":"source","format":"html"}]}
