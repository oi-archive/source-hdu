The shortest route to the contest might be over the tops of some mountains and through some valleys. From past experience you know that you perform badly in programming contests after experiencing large differences in altitude. Therefore you decide to take the route that minimizes the altitude difference, where the altitude difference of a route is the difference between the maximum and the minimum height on the route. Your job is to write a program that finds this route.<br>You are given:<br><br>the number of crossings and their altitudes, and<br><br>the roads by which these crossings are connected.<br>Your program must find the route that minimizes the altitude difference between the highest and the lowest point on the route. If there are multiple possibilities, choose the shortest one.<br>For example:<br><br><center><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"../../../data/images/C145-1004-1.jpg\"></center><br><br>In this case the shortest path from 1 to 7 would be through 2, 3 and 4, but the altitude difference of that path is 8. So, you prefer to go through 5, 6 and 4 for an altitude difference of 2. (Note that going from 6 directly to 7 directly would have the same difference in altitude, but the path would be longer!) <br>","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"On the first line an integer t (1 &lt;= t &lt;= 100): the number of test cases.
