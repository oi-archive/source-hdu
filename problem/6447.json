YJJ is always on journey. Either is he at the destination, or on the way to destination.<br> One day, he is going to travel from city A to southeastern city B. Let us assume that A is $(0, 0)$ on the rectangle map and B $(10^9, 10^9)$. YJJ is so busy so he never turn back or go twice the same way, he will only move to east, south or southeast, which means, if YJJ is at $(x, y)$ now $(0\\le x\\le 10^9,0\\le y\\le 10^9)$, he will only forward to $(x+1,y)$, $(x,y+1)$ or $(x+1,y+1)$.<br> On the rectangle map from $(0,0)$ to $(10^9,10^9)$, there are several villages scattering on the map. Villagers will do business deals with salesmen from northwestern, but not northern or western. In mathematical language, this means when there is a village $k$ on $(x_k, y_k)$ $(1\\le x_k\\le10^9, 1\\le y_k\\le10^9)$, only the one who was from $(x_k-1,y_k-1)$ to $(x_k,y_k)$ will be able to earn $v_k$ dollars.(YJJ may get different number of dollars from different village.)<br> YJJ  has no time to plan the path, can you help him to find maximum of dollars YJJ can get.","type":"description","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input contains an integer $T$ $(1&#x2264;T&#x2264;10)$,which is the number of test cases.<br><br>In each case, the first line of the input contains an integer $N$ $(1&#x2264;N&#x2264;10^5)$.The following $N$ lines, the $k$-th line contains 3 integers, $x_k, y_k, v_k$ $(0&#x2264;v_k&#x2264;10^3)$, which indicate that there is a village on $(x_k,y_k)$ and he can get $v_k$ dollars in that village.<br>The positions of each village is distinct.","type":"input_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Output","content":"The maximum of dollars YJJ can get.","type":"output_format","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Input","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">1\n3\n1 1 1\n1 2 2\n3 3 1</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Sample Output","content":"<pre><div style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;\">3</div></pre>","type":"example","format":"html","require":["katex"]},{"title":"Source","content":" <a href=\"/search.php?field=problem&amp;key=2018%D6%D0%B9%FA%B4%F3%D1%A7%C9%FA%B3%CC%D0%F2%C9%E8%BC%C6%BE%BA%C8%FC+-+%CD%F8%C2%E7%D1%A1%B0%CE%C8%FC&amp;source=1&amp;searchmode=source\"> 2018&#x4E2D;&#x56FD;&#x5927;&#x5B66;&#x751F;&#x7A0B;&#x5E8F;&#x8BBE;&#x8BA1;&#x7ADE;&#x8D5B; - &#x7F51;&#x7EDC;&#x9009;&#x62D4;&#x8D5B; </a> ","type":"source","format":"html","require":["katex"]}]}
