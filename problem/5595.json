Nevertheless, there are too many problems in the book yet GTW had a sheer number of things to do, such as dawdling away his time with his young girl. Thus, he asked you to solve these problems.<br><br>In each problem, you will be given a function whose form is like $f(x)=ax ^ 2 + bx + c$. Your assignment is to find the maximum value and the minimum value in the integer domain $[l, r]$.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line of the input file is an integer $T$, indicating the number of test cases.
