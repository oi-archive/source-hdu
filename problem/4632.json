For example, the sequence &lt;A, B, D&gt; is a subsequence of &lt;A, B, C, D, E, F&gt;.<br>(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence)<br><br>Given a string S, your task is to find out how many different subsequence of S is palindrome. Note that for any two subsequence X = &lt;S<sub>x1</sub>, S<sub>x2</sub>, ..., S<sub>xk</sub>&gt; and Y = &lt;S<sub>y1</sub>, S<sub>y2</sub>, ..., S<sub>yk</sub>&gt; , if there exist an integer i (1&lt;=i&lt;=k) such that xi != yi, the subsequence X and Y should be consider different even if S<sub>xi</sub> = S<sub>yi</sub>. Also two subsequences with different length should be considered different.","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"The first line contains only one integer T (T&lt;=50), which is the number of test cases.
