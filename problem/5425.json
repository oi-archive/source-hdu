Yuta is worrying about this situation, so he gives Rikka some math tasks to practice. There is one of them:<br><br>Now, Yuta has a tree with $n$ vertices. Let vertice 1 be the root and then for each vertice $i$ let $d_i$ be the distance between 1 and $i$. <br><br>Then Yuta wants to choose out at least two vertieces. It is clear that there have $2^n-n-1$ ways to choose. He will choose one of them equiprobable. Then let $f$ be the largest $d_i$ and $g$ be the second largest $d_i$ of the chosen vertices.($f$ may be equal to $g$)<br><br>Yuta wants to know the expected value of $\\frac{(f+1)(g+1)}{f+1+g+1}$.<br><br>It is too difficult for Rikka. Can you help her?<br>","type":"description","format":"html"},{"title":"Input","content":"There are no more than 100 testcases and there are no more than 3 testcases with $n \\geq 1000$<br><br>For each testcase, the first line contains a number $n(2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5)$.
